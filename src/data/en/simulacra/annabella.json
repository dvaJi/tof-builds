  "info": "A stereotypical maid who's calm, poised, composed, elegant, and able to handle all kinds of emergencies... or that's how it's supposed to be. She has a habit of needing a direct command from her \"Master\" for every minuscule thing she does before doing them, while also reporting back at every step. The inability to make any kind of decisions is her fatal weakness, which causes a bit of an awkward \"lag\" in actual operations. Also, despite being always polite and courteous, curiously enough, she does sometimes use rather coarse language in her usual humble tone... ",
  "description": "One of the seven great urban legends on Mirroria's anonymous forumâ€”the crimson vampire maid who lurks in the lower city...\nThe mysterious girl turns out to be holding multiple part-time jobs, which even include being a bodyguard, just to make a living. As it doesn't really seem out of the ordinary, the urban legend has been found to be gossip that was blown out of proportion.\nShe herself insists that she is only a servant who does her job and follows the commands of her \"Master\" on the other end of the communicator. The identity of this \"Master,\" however, remains a mystery.\nThat said, she does feel like a vampire in some regards... but she probably is just an ordinary person who's good at shooter games and talks a bit weirdly...\n",
