  "info": "An introverted and innocent girl who doesn't know much about the world. She is kinda afraid of strangers and prefers staying alone. Maybe that is why she is somewhat scared and shy in front of strangers. \nAlways called \"the kid with Madam Lin,\" she developed a sense of purposeâ€”she must work harder and become stronger so that she wouldn't be a burden to Lin or let Lin's instructions go in vain.",
  "description": "The daughter of an old friend to Lin. And somehow, she's now taken care of by Lin, and they even take action together. The girl doesn't seem strong, like a sick, weak child. \nShe is currently under combat skill training for self-protection upon Lin's request. Though Ruby is learning something quite different from Lin's style, she is, at least, much healthier than before and capable enough for quite some tricky situations. \nShe still has nothing but a vague idea about the world and herself, believing in Lin's instructions and description blindly, and relying on her for almost every decision. In the current situation, Lin comments that cultivating her independence is definitely the priority here.",
