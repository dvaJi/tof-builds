At times, he can show a level of maturity and discipline beyond his age, and he is exceptionally perceptive. But most of the time, he can't be any less interested in other peoples' words, and doesn't bother remembering things that serve him no interest.",
  "description": "A geeky, computer genius who looks around 15 years old, born in Banges and nicknamed \"Zero\". However, his real name and personal details have been lost, deliberately destroyed by himself.\nHighly adept at intelligence processing, electronic communications, and data management, Zero can find and extract huge amounts of information through the computer and network analysis. He once shocked Hykros by penetrating their security system in an audacious cyberattack, which led to him being designated a \"person of interest\". At present, Zero is under Hykros's strict control and oversight in an undisclosed location, where he engages in intelligence-related operations.",
