  "info": "An opportunist who trims her sails with the wind. Proactive, talkative, and loves to hang out.\nShe makes friends easily and doesn't get angry even when someone points out her opportunistic tendencies. She also has an open mind that is always taking in new and different ideas.\nOn the other hand, she is definitely not the kind of person who provides a sense of security.",
  "description": "Hane's résumé shows that she spent some time at the Astra Shelter, was once a Hyena officer, and was an employee at Hykros, which her Simulacrum data is based on.\nAfter that, she chose to betray Hykros and joined the Heirs of Aida.\nThe only word to describe her would be \"unstable.\" No one knows what she's up to right now, but we can be sure that with her abilities, she is definitely not just a foot soldier in the Heirs.\nShe does not pick sides according to ideals, right or wrong, objectives or rules, as if none of these matters to her. She belonged to so many organizations, but she also didn't belong in any of them.",
