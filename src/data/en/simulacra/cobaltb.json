  "info": "Appeared as a very serious, by-the-book scientist, but actually a flexible anti-stereotype.\nHardly shows any expression as if he had no facial muscles. But one can obviously tell he is not aloof after getting to know him, with many emotions and thoughts of his own, such as puffing his cheeks out when he's angry.\nDespite being a leading scientist in the development of cybernetics, he often goes by instinct rather than logic.\nRelies on strong intuitions to modify machines, though not above adding completely useless attachments just for preference.",
  "description": "Cobalt-B, which is not her real name, is a mechanical engineer on the Hykros weapon development team. Her position isn't too high up on the corporate ladder, because her test results aren't very good.\nOnly the people that she works with know that she is, in fact, the ace of the entire team. She doesn't care about basic theories, and only creates extremely effective weapons based on her instinct.\nTo test these weapons and collect combat data, she occasionally goes on operations with other soldiers and tries her weapons on poor Hyena members.",
