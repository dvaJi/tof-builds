  "description": "Cobalt-B, which is not her real name, is a mechanical engineer on the Banges Tech weapon development team. Her position isn't too high up on the corporate ladder, because her test results aren't very good.\nOnly the people that she works with know that she is, in fact, the ace of the entire team. She doesn't care about basic theories, and only creates extremely effective weapons based on her instinct.\nTo test these weapons and collect combat data, she occasionally goes on operations with other soldiers and tries her weapons on poor Hyena members.",
