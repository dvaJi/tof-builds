  "info": "A lively and cheerful personality who brightens up any room. Frank and extroverted, he is optimistic in any situation but can be overly proud at times\nOften practices some eye-catching dagger tricks and has a repertoire of dry jokes that he finds hilarious. He likes delivering these jokes as though he were on stage.\nWhat beneath his cheery and carefree attitude, are unshakeable willpower and determination. Keen to achieve his goals no matter what is in his way. Sometimes pushes himself too hard.",
  "description": "As an ex-Executor, Crow maintains a good relationship with Hykros. He didn't make any critical mistakes, and he was not let go due to poor performance. He simply realized that he longed for a life with fewer rules after working with the team there for a while, and made the decision that worked for him.\nHe now travels freely over long periods of time. His cheerful personality leaves a great first impression on those who he comes across, and he always performs new tricks or jokes when he arrives at a new place. They call him Crowy, and he doesn't mind.",
