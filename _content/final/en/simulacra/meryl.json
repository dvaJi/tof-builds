  "description": "A high-ranking Hykros Executor of unknown age or place of birth. According to the little publicly-available information, Meryl distinguished herself in many Hykros S Grade missions due to her exceptional sword skills and combat prowess. In just a few short years, she was promoted from ordinary administrator to senior Executor.\nMeryl's cold and inscrutable attitude means that no one can ever be sure of her true intentions. This frostiness, along with her merciless approach to dealing with enemies, ensures that everyone maintains their distance from her.\nThe Executor database does show that Meryl has a twin brother, with whom she has a close relationship, but there is no formal record or information about him.",
