  "info": "She's antisocial, dislikes strangers, and gets nervous when meeting someone for the first time.\nShe doesn't even pay much attention to her partner, and only gets excited when the topic is something she is interested in. But then she talks a mile a minute, and gets angry when her partner can't keep up.\nShe's almost like a catâ€”cold and aloof most of the time, but gets angry when she wants attention and no one is around.",
  "description": "\"A lone-wolf ocean maniac\" is what people say about Shiro, the oceanographer. This aloof girl becomes someone passionate and loyal when she's looking at the ocean.\nWhen she came of age and showed her knack for oceanography, she traveled alone for several years and measured the ocean distribution of Aida, a monumental task that contributed significantly to humankind's understanding of Aida.",
