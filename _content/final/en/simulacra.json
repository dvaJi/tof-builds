She only recently took over the leadership, so she still seems a little overwhelmed and flustered when handling her work.\nThe sudden passing of the previous leader left Bai Ling in shock, and her over-worrying and anxiety-prone personality was also questioned by some members of the shelter. She considers leadership a heavy burden, and is often worried about how to make sure everything runs smoothly.\nBut she is also considerate, responsible, meticulous, and good at bookkeeping, so at the moment, HT201 looks like it's in good hands.",

With a bite far worse than his bark, he exudes pure intimidation and aggression every minute of every day. Though his temper can be problematic, communicating with KING is far from difficult.\nConstantly seeking stimulation, KING prioritizes the satisfaction of material desires; to that end, he prizes concision and the clear monetary value of things, and hates liars and pretentious people.\nKING often resorts to violence in order to solve problems and obtain what he wants, and is not particularly fond of elaborate strategies (in combat, or otherwise).\nThose who spend a small amount of time with KING may realize that he is nothing more than a strong and simple man; they would do well to keep those thoughts to themselves, even if they mean no harm by saying so.",

Usually, anyone unable to afford payment gets sent to work in the mines, but he never got such treatment.\nIt's not that the Association didn't want to, but even if they did post big bounties and spare no arms or efforts, they still couldn't touch him.\nAs a merc famous for his combat prowess, KING is touted as the personification of violence. He's been fighting since childhood and is a veteran brawler specializing in one-against-many. He would get lucrative pays for each job, only to supposedly blow it all immediately.",

According to the little publicly-available information, Meryl distinguished herself in many Hykros S Grade missions due to her exceptional sword skills and combat prowess. In just a few short years, she was promoted from ordinary administrator to senior Executor.\nMeryl's cold and inscrutable attitude means that no one can ever be sure of her true intentions. This frostiness, along with her merciless approach to dealing with enemies, ensures that everyone maintains their distance from her.\nThe Executor database does show that Meryl has a twin brother, with whom she has a close relationship, but there is no formal record or information about him.",
