  "Year 2567: Humans set foot on Vera for the first time. A city settlement called Mirroria gradually formed in a mineral-rich area of Vera.\r\nYear 2656: Hykros assessed that it would be necessary to build a Tower of Fantasy in Vera to ensure the smooth progress of Project Prism.\r\nYear 2657: The construction plan of the Vera Tower of Fantasy was launched, and Hykros' District 7 was established.": "Vera-history-content-2",
  "In the year 2656, it was verified that the orbit of Comet Mara might have been offset. For the stable operation of Project Prism, a place in Mirroria was proposed for the construction of Tower of Fantasy No. 7.\r\n\"Despite a significant number of people voicing concerns about the construction of the Tower of Fantasy, the construction plan for the Tower of Fantasy No.7 still ultimately launched.\"": "Vera-history-content-9",
  "Year 2664: The Cataclysm broke out. The energy released by the Cataclysm affected Tower of Fantasy No. 7, irreversibly destroying the components of the tower. To this day, Vera Tower of Fantasy, the seventh tower, has still not recovered its functions.\r\nYear 2666: The Cataclysm led to the extinction of many creatures in Vera, which made Vera's already fragile ecology deteriorate rapidly, turning the surface to desert in a short period of time. Mirroria's functions were disabled, and a large number of people couldn't continue to survive on the surface.\r\nYear 2667: Hykros' District 7 in Mirroria started to accept Mirrorian refugees. At the same time, temporary management regulations on energy supply, material allocation, population control, and other aspects were promulgated.": "Vera-history-content-3",

  "After the Cataclysm in the year 2664, the District 7 of Hykros issued a temporary management regulation, which covered various aspects such as energy supply, material deployment, and population control.\r\nAccording to the regulation, a total of about 57,000 survivors who had taken refuge in Mirroria were forced to move to the environmentally harsh surface, and most of them did not hold out until the Mirror Palace was reopened for immigration.\r\nOn February 8, 2695, this version of the management regulation was revoked.": "Vera-history-content-8",
  "In 2667, when an exploration team explored the underground karst cave recorded as number Z-059, it found that the cave led to a mysterious huge underground space with many underground rivers. The leaders of Mirroria instantly took this information seriously. As the Omnium radiation levels were still high on the surface of Vera, to alleviate resource and population problems in Mirroria, the plan to build a second underground city was added to the agenda.\r\nThe plan was officially implemented in 2668. After the completion of early construction work, more than 20,000 Mirroria residents were transferred to the second city. Even now, planned expansions of the second city are still underway.": "Vera-history-content-12",

  "Year 2680: Mirroria was reaching its internal resource carrying capacity limit, and the streets of Mirroria had become less safe due to the increasingly severe shortage of resources. As more people began to consider the possibility of surviving on the surface and proposed to improve the environment of Vera, the idea of returning to the surface gained traction.\r\nYear 2685: The Environmental Restoration Project was officially proposed. It would gradually restore the overall ecological environment of Vera by installing many pieces of environmental monitoring equipment on the surface to carry out systematic ecological restorations in key areas to support the resettlement plan. Wayne, the incumbent Archon of Mirroria back then, spearheaded a series of related supporting projects.\r\nYear 2689: The Environmental Restoration Project was officially launched.\r\nYear 2692: The installation of the supporting equipment for the ecological restoration reached 95% completion.\r\nYear 2695: The Environmental Restoration Project achieved progressive results. Some areas of Vera became habitable, and some residents of Mirroria moved out.\r\nYear 2698: Wayne resigned as the Archon due to poor health and was succeeded by Harunobu, who continued to implement the Environmental Restoration Project.": "Vera-history-content-4",
  "In 2681, Hykros' District 7 restarted the spacetime engine project. As this project had unpredictable safety issues, Hykros built the Silvercoast Research Station far away from its headquarters in Mirroria.\r\nSeveral Omnium-related research projects other than the spacetime engine project were also moved to this research station in the following years to avoid potential Omnium disaster risks.": "Vera-history-content-31",
  "Year 2701: Grayspace Entities emerged. Assault from these unknown creatures damaged many monitoring stations on the surface and forced the project's suspension.\r\nYear 2703: Abyssant emerged. Mankind was not able to withstand these lethal Grayspace Entities.\r\nYear 2704: Devourers emerged. The Abyssant threat could not be dealt with and the restoration effort officially failed. Mankind retreated back to Mirroria and relied on force fields to fend off the entities. The ecology of Vera was worse than ever.\r\nYear 2710: District 7 and District 9 formed a partnership.

The camp of squad P-7 was located, but the squad's personnel were failed to be found.\r\nThe search and rescue team recovered the remaining exploration data.

  "Hope Town, settlement No. 27, was the largest and the latest of the series of settlements established under the Vera immigration project. According to statistics, there were about 10,000 permanent residents in Hope Town before the Cataclysm.\r\nAfter the Cataclysm, an exploration squad of Mirroria re-arrived at the former site of Hope Town. According to the various records found there, some survivors survived after the Cataclysm, until a few years later, when their supplies were eventually exhausted. A diary left by a survivor named K.
