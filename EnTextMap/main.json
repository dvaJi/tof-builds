Hiding things from you all along, leaving you alone in this world... I've been incredibly selfish, but I wanted to prove our theory at all costs, and I was willing to make any sacrifice necessary to accomplish that goal. I wanted to see the full potential of our experiment, to see if we could rewind time to before the Cataclysm and prevent it from ever happening. I wanted to free the world of Omnium's scourge, and put an end to all the strife, the rivalry, and the hatred... In a world like that, no one would need to wear suppressors anymore; they could live their lives freely and happily, without the threat of aberration or death, and the land could return to normal. Isn't that the reason we continue with our research, to make it happen?\r\nNo one else is going to realize our dream for us, Claire, it's up to us to travel back in time, and bring beauty and life back to this broken world. Our theory along with the commissioning of the equipment has been quite complete, and there is certainly no problem with our experiment. So these messages left, rather than farewell or suicide note, should be more of a routine, right? Ha-ha-ha, don't you always write before every experiment?\r\nI've set the permissions and will give this to my friend later. If I get back safely, I'll go to him and ask for it back.\r\nIf I really didn't come back and you read these words...\r\nClaire... The future will be long and difficult, so please...

  "Test Instructions\r\nWanderers' purchases in the Suppressor - Final Test will all be refunded according to the \"Suppressor - Final Test Purchase Refund Policy\" after the official launch.\r\n\r\nSuppressor - Final Test Purchase Refund Policy\r\n1. The total amount of your purchases will be refunded to you in the form of Tanium at progressive rates after the official launch. 1 USD = 10 Tanium.\r\n2. Standard: \r\nView the related page for the detailed progressive rates.\r\n3. Tanium refunded in different brackets will be added together to be the total amount you'll receive.\r\n4. For Monthly Passes, Passes, Cash Packs, etc., in the Suppressor - Final Test, only the amount of your purchase will be refunded. Other rewards will not be included.\r\n\r\nExample\r\nShrooman has made purchases of 648 USD in the Suppressor - Final Test.\r\nFor the 0–6 USD segment of his spending, 6 × 500% × 10 = 300 Tanium will be refunded to him.\r\nFor the 7–100 USD segment, (100 - 6) × 400% × 10 = 3760 Tanium will be refunded.\r\nFor the 101–648 USD segment, (648 - 100) × 300% × 10 = 16440 Tanium will be refunded.\r\nTherefore, 300 + 3760 + 16440 = 20500 Tanium is the total amount Shrooman will receive.\r\n\r\nRefund Calculation Rules\r\nPurchases made by the same account across servers in the Suppressor - Final Test will all be counted for the refund.\r\nFor example, during the test period, Shrooman has spent 10 USD on Server A and 20 USD on Server B, which adds up to 30 USD in total. Here is how we get the total amount of refund he'll get: \r\nFor the 0–6 USD segment, he'll get 6 × 500% × 10 = 300 Tanium.\r\nFor the 7–30 USD segment, he'll get (30 - 6) × 400% × 10 = 960 Tanium.\r\nIn total, he'll get: 300 + 960 = 1260 Tanium.\r\n\r\nRefund Collection Rules\r\n1. Wanderers' purchases in the Suppressor - Final Test will all be refunded in Tanium to one account according to the \"Suppressor - Final Test Purchase Refund Policy\" after the official launch.\r\n2. The refund amount of the Suppressor - Final Test is calculated separately from that of the Suppressor - Amplification Test (3). If Wanderers have made purchases in both tests, the amount spent in both tests will be refunded after the official launch.\r\n3. The refunded amount can be collected on the refund page in game.

  "Um, I don't know him that well. This kid is quite interested in mechanics and he has written me several letters.": "TK-Vrun105-004",
  "Yes. In fact... my dream is to resign, head to the Smart Servant Cafe at lower city and be a sweeper over there.": "8E88428548A500AB07013B8D112B5C6C",

  "Received. Working on possible coordinates.": "TKS-V331-026",

  "Good work, Giggs.": "UI-talk4052",
  "Hmm, you youngsters sure are smart.": "v22200-tk-npc502-025",

  "Hmm, you are very motivated, but, our time is limited. In order to ensure that our goals are completed on time, team members must learn to divide their work and collaborate.": "TK-V361-V035",
  "Well, anyway. Thank you for your concern...": "TK-Vqa109-061",
  "As long as you understand.": "v22000-npc365-014",
  "Okay, I'll be mindful of that.": "UI-talk1184",
  "I will. Let's go.": "HM-Hotta_toabyss01_ALL-02",
  "Hmm... What if I deliver this to Oz and ask him for you?": "068-2",
  "I'm fine, but the Hyena forays are going to be a big problem. Do you know where their nearest stronghold is?": "npc0093_5",
  "Okay, I will tell my mom... about the path I have chosen.": "TK-Vrun462-021",

  "Yep! Melo's speech functions are completely restored.": "npc313_16",
  "Well, after all, with my superior disguise skills... maybe she really thought I was just an ordinary nurse.": "TK-Vqa111-038",
  "Well, if you don't have the time, I guess that's that. Come to see us when you're free, though, and we'd love to work with you again.": "v22000-npc365-008",
  "Yeah, no problem! Leave it to me!": "v22200-TK-player-051-1_f",

  "Yeah, I'm done. I'll do my best to <blue>pass this on to Claire</>.": "npc101_73",
  "Yes, we could do that. The priority for a solo instance boss is to design the enemy. Ms. Wei's scene designing could come later.": "v22200-tk-npc509-016",
  "Yeah, I can confirm that you've successfully completed your task. And Ms. Jiajia is full of praise for you. How are you settling into your work here at HOTTA?": "v22000-npc365-033",

  "Of sorts, yes.": "8E4DE6764A948B5AA2DDCAA7EE1790B3",

  "Yeah. Let's give it our all.": "bandrelax_106_004",

  "Starting log...\r\nThe construction of Artificial Island Phase 1 is almost complete. What is most crucial right now is to drive the Hyenas away, and the quickest solution for that would be to request The Executor Order for assistance. Gosh, I'm so clever! Anyways, I'll suggest it to Mr. Kolador right this instant...\r\nI've heard from a friend of Hykros that they've recently gotten hold of Vera's spacetime coordinates. I'd love to be able to head on over there to take a look once I'm done with my work on the Artificial Island...": "HomeDevelopLog_10",
  "Starting log...\r\nToday, we've debugged the spacerift on Artificial Island. All was normal, and everything went on smoothly. Mr. Kolador is such a wonderful man, as he didn't give me a hard time due to the retracement incident. However, my friend wasn't as lucky since he was fired by Cobalt-B today. Regardless of how I asked, he refused to tell me the reason. Yet, all that came out of his mouth was the word, moodcard, which I have absolutely no clue about.\r\nIt was probably some embarrassing mistake. After all, Cobalt-B holds such a high bar.": "HomeDevelopLog_2",
  "Starting log...\r\nThe vacation is over, and the Artificial Island is stable for now. I hope Mr. Kolador will give me an extra reward for my performance during the vacation! Besides, I found something suspicious today! It's so suspicious! A colleague of mine came back from his vacation with very thick hair!\r\nHe used to be just like me... No, even worse than me! What on earth did he do during the vacation?! Perhaps I should go and ask him about it...": "HomeDevelopLog_8",
  "Starting log...\r\nI'm so excited, so excited! You have no idea what I saw today! I met Ms. Bai from the \"other planet\" in Navia! She was on a mission, but I'm sure she noticed me!\r\nAlthough she was far away, she must have seen me! Yes, I felt it! Initiate Hykros Special Order, and search for \"Alaya\"...": "HomeDevelopLog_6",
  "Starting log...\r\nMy colleagues have all gone bonkers! These fools have taken advantage of the SSR weapons Hykros provided for the people of Aesperia and started a fight with the Hyenas on the Artificial Island.\r\nYou're just technicians, not Executors! So, get back to work! I'm the only one here working my butt off! If you were to read this log of mine, my esteemed Mr. Kolador, I'd hope you'll consider giving me a raise since that's definitely the best way to affirm my value. With that said, should I choose Dual EM Stars or Rosy Edge?": "HomeDevelopLog_3",
  "Starting log...\r\nLast night, I went to Cetus Island on my lonesome to watch the fireworks. Not only was it spectacular, but the music was also wonderful. That's why I proposed to Mr. Kolador that we should set off fireworks all day long on Artificial Island. However, he rejected the romantic proposal on the grounds that it might blow up the island's barrier.\r\nIf Dr. Claire requires a staff member who's not just a puppet, I'm willing to join her... Never mind, please delete this paragraph. Mr. Kolador was quite right in what he said. That was thoughtless of me, and there's still so much I have to learn from him.": "HomeDevelopLog_4",
  "Starting log...\r\nRight now, I'm logging with my \"little feet,\" stomping on the keyboard. Hykros' stuff is so unstable! Their weapons went haywire and shrunk me to the size of a needlebee, and I almost got swatted by the Executors!\r\nDevelopment on the Artificial Island will have to be put on hold today. After all, it's too inconvenient for this \"tiny me\" to work. Mr. Kolador would understand me. Hopefully, Hykros will solve this problem within a week.": "HomeDevelopLog_5",
  "Starting log...\r\nIt's early in the morning, and Mr. Kolador said there'd been an unusual retracement on the Artificial Island we're developing. How is that possible? He must be making a fuss. Retracement is a core technology of Hykros that only they can master. As an ordinary technician, if I can make it happen...\r\nUm..? There really is a transient unstable retracement, which seems to be related to the spacerift. I gotta fix it quickly. Am I losing my job? Maybe I'm qualified for Hykros now...?": "HomeDevelopLog_1",
  "Starting log...\r\nI should be on my vacation now, but there is a new problem with the Artificial Island... So here I am again. Right now, everyone outside the Artificial Island must be setting off fireworks... I could really use a nap right now... a nap... right now... ZZzzz": "HomeDevelopLog_7",
  "Starting log...\r\nThere has been a minor issue with Banges recently, but Hykros managed the situation well. Now, some Banges residents, including me, are in quarantine. But! Quarantine won't stop me from developing the Artificial Island! Just connect to the Artificial Island server remotely, and I can start the work of love! Ah... the connection is so poor...\r\nHope everyone in Banges can get better quickly, and for all of Aida to get better, come on!": "HomeDevelopLog_9",

  "How it works: \r\n1. Claim your free Omnium collector every day and place it anywhere to collect Omnium in the environment.\r\n2. If not found by other Wanderers, your Omnium collector will be fully charged in 24 hours and yield rewards in proportion with its grade.\r\n3. Upon deployment, the Omnium collector will broadcast irregular signals identifying its location. Wanderers who pick up the signal and trace it to the root will obtain abundant rewards.\r\n5. The Omnium collector broadcasts in three possible patterns: complete location, partial location, and location fragment.\r\nComplete location: Any Wanderer who picks up this signal can hunt for the collector independently. \r\nPartial location: The signal is a clue that leads to another Wanderer who has the other half of the location. Two Wanderers must team up to find the Omnium collector.\r\nLocation fragment: The signal is a clue that leads to two other Wanderers with more fragments. All three Wanderers must team up to find the Omnium collector.": "E775C86342AC9BDF9BD6A3A86EA0EF4F",

It feels like every day is exactly the same: laying in bed, watching the IV drip... It's normal to feel this way, right? Even so, the doctors say that it's a bad sign, so they're sending me to a new laboratory for treatment. They call it the \"X-7 Research Lab\"... I hope things will be better there.\r\nI had a dream last night: we were gathering all kinds of props to pull off a huge prank... Sounds kind of childish, right? I miss those days more than anything... We'll see each other once I get better, okay? I'm sure we'll be able to spend more happy days together soon...\r\nIt's time for my treatment again, so I have to stop here. I'll try to write you a longer letter next time, so look forward to it.\r\nPeach": "semir-letter-2",
