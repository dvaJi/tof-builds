But even so, she has yet to awaken from her coma.\"\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nClaudia would never regret the decision she made during that mission; she was fully aware that the Heirs of Aida had laid a desperate trap, and planned to take her down along with themselves, if necessary.

Though her physical injuries were mended, her mind was trapped within a deep coma.\r\n\r\nThere she laid, day after day, in a stifling and oppressive silence broken only by the sound of her slow, even breathing.\r\n\r\nLike every other bedridden patient, her body began to atrophy over time. If she could see herself, she would likely shake her head and smile bitterly at everything; the state of her physique, the unfamiliarity of her once-proud swordsmanship, and the loss of many of her most-trusted Executors.\r\n\r\nEven so, she could never regret the decisions she made.\r\n\r\nShe has always been determined to press onward; this was her father's expectation and her means of executing justice.\r\n\r\nBut for now, there is only the rhythmic, uniform sound of breathing in her hospital room.": "text_Claudia_04",

  "Cobalt-B's real name is Lunis. Her parents were gambling addicts that owed Banges a lot of money, so they were working at Crown Mines to pay their debt even before she was born. Because of their relationships with those around them, Lunis knew what the dark side of Crown Mines looked like.\r\n\r\nBut she was unlike her parents, and unlike the miners' children.\r\n\r\nIf we go back far enough, it started with a piece of scrap that was given to her as a toy.\r\n\r\nShe started showing interest in machines without being taught anything. It was her talent and her \"feel\" that helped her get her foot in the door and her eventual mastery of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she got older, she was determined to pay the family debt with her ability and get them out of the mines.\r\n\r\nShe reached her goal quickly, but there was no record of how she managed to earn a sum to buy out her parents' debt.\r\n\r\nThe only thing we know is that she doesn't seem to care too much about wealth, just like how she doesn't really care about her ordinary salary, which is way too low for someone of her caliber.\r\n\r\nSome say that even now her parents are still eyeing her ability to make money for them to keep gambling. To keep doing what she wants to do, she had to cut them off.\r\n\r\nShe doesn't need distractions now.\r\n\r\nIt's also why she calls herself \"Cobalt-B,\" so that they can't track her down.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer real name isn't technically confidential information, but out of respect and etiquette, we ask that you use her code name whenever possible.": "text_cobalt_achieves_3",

I'll leave it at that.\r\n\r\nWe need to create some rules against him, like some sort of trap, and then we can ban him when he violates that rule. Then we create a shared black list and ban him from all of our matches forever. We need to make sure we're all on the same page, so that he doesn't think it's one of us picking on him.\r\n\r\nBut you can't get on his bad side. Refer him to some other jobs if you can.

  "On the outside, Claudia is prone to giving others the impression of being cold and arrogant, but the top-notch Executor is not nearly as unapproachable as she seems. Those who are familiar with Claudia know that she's extremely passionate and even overly kind in some regards. Something as small as sorting scraps, all the way up to redeeming justice on the streets, Claudia has always been willing to help and protect others; she even takes on additional patrol duties while not on missions. Her passion for justice, along with her staunch desire to aid others, has made her a hero in the eyes of many.\r\n\r\nTraveling the world year-round while carrying out missions for Hykros, Claudia has become well-versed in the cultures and traditions of various locales; her mannerisms and behavior inadvertently reveal her vast, worldly knowledge and experience. In addition, as a natural-born leader, Claudia is often chosen to spearhead the missions to which she is assigned. Careful and meticulous, she calmly assesses any situation and handles it rationally and efficiently; as a result, her fellow Executors are often thrilled to be on assignment with her. She is even seen as a goddess of victory, a guarantee that everything will proceed smoothly and without fail.\r\n\r\nThe other Executors of Hykros admire Claudia for her ability and personality and are even drawn to her and her leadership.

I swear.\r\n\r\nWhen she filled out the forms during the application process, she only answered the bare minimum on every single question, which was not really acceptable. But her test results were so good that they only checked the bare minimum, which were her background and reason for joining, before admitting her.\r\n\r\nThere was evidence that she was in Banges the whole time before joining Hykros. She never even touched a weapon when she was a teenager. It really seemed like this girl, who could have lived an otherwise uneventful life, only wanted to join Hykros, and that becoming an Executor was a nice bonus. I think she came looking for a friend in Hykros.\r\n\r\nWho is this friend? I have no idea, and she has never mentioned it. She doesn't like it when people ask her about it, either. For your own good, you should stay away from this question.\r\n\r\nBut if I were to guess, I'd say that the friend is not someone that anyone can meet easily. I've never seen anyone having a good time with Samir. And given what I know about her, if she's already accomplished her objective, why would she still be here?

She has a condition that became resistant to just about every common drug they tried.\r\n\r\nTo cure her insomnia, they even tried going into her dreams to find the root of the problem so they could combat it.\r\n\r\nBut the results were not promising, and the doctor that came back from \"that place\" fell into silence and fear for a period of time. It took a lot of effort just to bring him back.\r\n\r\nWhen he finally spoke, he said that he couldn't describe exactly what happened in the dream and what he saw. After a while, all he could muster was that there was a thunderstorm that didn't stop. Then he put his head in his hands and sighed. Clearly, it was a suffocating nightmare.\r\n\r\nEventually, he concluded, \"Should we really cure her insomnia? I'm not trying to run away from my responsibility as a doctor, but I must say that if we have other means to somehow replenish the part of stamina that normally derives from sleep, maybe it's better for her if we leave her insomnia alone. After all, if I were having the same dreams every single day, I'd want to run away. If I could do that by staying awake, then I'd just not sleep and use my time to do something. At least when I'm awake, this world feels... safe. At least that's how I felt when I was 'there'.\"": "text_peppa_achieves_3",

It's not because Huma is difficult, but rather... something simple. Maybe it's because of her superhuman strength, or her dominating aura during battle, or even the fact that she just looks like a serious person even on her days off, but other Executors fear and respect her, and don't treat her like a friend. They only know the most basic information about her, and never tried to dig deeper. On the other hand, after seeing how awkward it is for the others, Huma sighs and goes back to her book, even though she really wants to get to know them.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, she realized something else: she has an affinity toward animals.\r\n\r\nFirst, it was a dog wagging its tail in front of her. Then some bunnies came to hang out with her. A cat in the shelter that doesn't like strangers slept on her knees for an afternoon. She started spending more time on the surface just so she could be with these animals.\r\n\r\nIt's easy for humans to build walls that divide one another, and they will always find more reasons to not remove these walls.

Her seniors often praise her improvements, and the medical staff marvel at her transformation. She is expanding her social circle and exploring her surroundings, like a hatchling that is about to make its first sounds.\r\n\r\nBut since she lost all of her memories, her experiences and her understanding of what this particular world has gone through are on the same level as a seven-year-old child. Going out and actually seeing what's happening on Aida is akin to exploring the unknown. Will she become jaded after finding out what has happened to this world?

She sought to protect others and preserve justice like her kind and courageous father, who served as her hero, idol, and inspiration. Through rigorous training and endless studying, she slowly drew closer to her goal set forth by her father's example.\r\n\r\nTo become a top-notch Executor and fight at her father's side; was Claudia's greatest aspiration. Fate, however, had other plans for her; during a perilous mission, Claudia's father made the ultimate sacrifice, giving his life to protect his allies. Since Claudia and her mother were not privy to the Executor Order's internal affairs at the time, she was only given minimal details surrounding the mission that resulted in her father's death.\r\n\r\nHer father's death while in the line of duty was a turning point in Claudia's life; with her mother's support, she applied to join the Executor Order, and gained entry into their ranks earlier than most. While carrying out her orders from Hykros, she also dedicated herself to investigating the circumstances surrounding her father's death; during the course of her research, the details of a clandestine project known as Operation Dark Apocalypse slowly began to surface.

  "Anyone with half a brain knows that borrowing money from the Banges Chamber of Commerce is the first step toward indentured servitude. Only two types of people do that: idiots that think they can make the payments on time (spoiler alert: they can't), and gambling addicts that hoped for one last lucky hand to turn everything around (spoiler again: that hand will never come). They both end up in the mines for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nAnd there's KING. He didn't know this was a dead-end when he borrowed the money, but once he did, he handled it in the only way he could—never returning any.\r\n\r\nSome say that when combined with interests, he owes the Chamber of Commerce an astronomical sum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe debt collectors never managed to get any money from him, but they were beaten senseless every single time. They thought he had gang connections at first, but after further investigation, they had to admit that he had no such connections. The results were very vague: \"there is nothing on him, and this is all we have.\"\r\n\r\nHistory that cannot be fact-checked. Past that has been buried. A future without certainty.\r\n\r\nThe only thing they have is the present, but they don't even know how the name \"KING\" came about.\r\n\r\nMaybe people called him that because of how he forced his way to the top in the mines, or how he managed to stay at the top of the arena.

Ultimately, through some... special means, Huma took part in a pioneering experiment and was able to wake up.

Medical staff are not trained in combat, and Cocoritter certainly doesn't look like she can fight.

She couldn't take out enemies as fast as Executors could, but she was perfectly capable of defending herself. It also showed her determination to go down and help those at the shelter.

  "How to define \"superhuman strength\"?\r\n\r\nFor an ordinary person, it might mean lifting a heavy object under extreme pressure; Huma, however, can calmly and efficiently lift objects requiring a Cybernetic Arm.\r\n\r\nHykros researchers hypothesize that her superhuman strength is an aftereffect of her illness, one that will likely remain with her for the rest of her life. After the medical staff discovered the presence of this aftereffect, Huma's first rehabilitation task was to learn to control her immense strength. Like picking up a glass of water, simple, mundane tasks proved to be nearly-insurmountable challenges for Huma. For this reason, the doctors and nurses tasked with her treatment could not help but applaud softly when she was finally able to take a sip of her drink without shattering the glass; they were fully aware of how much effort Huma had put into this simple act.\r\n\r\nThe Molten Shield V2 is a specially designed weapon for Huma upon her acceptance into the Executor Order. A versatile weapon that can switch freely between shield and axe forms, Huma seems to appreciate the fighting style to which it lends itself; with it, she can become either the ultimate shield or the ultimate spear, as necessary. Though her expression is often inscrutable, perhaps her actions reflect her heart's innermost beliefs and hopes?": "text_huma_02",

Her tone of voice, actions, and aloofness can be discerned by even the most oblivious of people, and serve as a natural deterrent for any would-be approachers.\r\n\r\nSamir tends to keep away from others unless she needs them...

  "At first, finding a weapon that suited Claudia perfectly was no easy task. Even without weapons, she could destroy most objects around her. She was obsessed with swordsmanship, and wanted more than anything to apply the art of the blade in hands-on combat scenarios. However, due to Claudia's destructive and somewhat savage fighting style, finding her a perfect weapon proved to be a herculean task; it was not until she tried and destroyed countless weapons that she finally found the perfect one—Red Lotus.\r\n\r\nThe Red Lotus is a weapon created purely by mistake in the Hykros weapons department. During experimental trials for the weapon, an accident led to a minor explosion in the laboratory; while sorting out the wreckage, Hykros workers discovered the weapon lying in the rubble, perfectly intact. Not only did it have incredibly destructive capabilities, but it also could not be destroyed by any means known to the researchers. After assessing its safety and stability, the department decided to seal away the blade and forbade its use under any circumstances... That is, until Claudia came along. As the researchers scratched their heads, wondering how to provide Claudia with a suitable weapon, one person suggested testing her compatibility with the \"forbidden blade.\" Thus, Claudia and the Red Lotus were finally introduced to one another; naturally, the weapon had no such name at the given time.\r\n\r\nWith the department's assistance, Claudia began the test of this special blade. Her solid grasp of swordsmanship, coupled with her impressive level of skill, demonstrated incredible handling and brought out its full potential. In addition, Claudia could unleash every ounce of her power without worrying about yet another broken weapon. Simply put, the two were a match made in heaven.\r\n\r\nAs for its name, Claudia believed that her new weapon was a living, sentient being, as such, deserved a memorable name. At her mother's suggestion, Claudia chose her father's favorite flower as her blade's namesake. The red lotus symbolizes fortitude and composure, and unyielding courage with love in the face of adversity.": "text_Claudia_03",
  "Anyone would find it unbelievable, wouldn't they? She is a mechanical engineer and creates machines used by others in combat. Her job doesn't require actual combat knowledge, and she has close to no real combat experience, but she can somehow get out there and survive, sometimes even outperforming our soldiers.\r\n\r\nShe says things like, \"it was just instinct,\" and she took certain actions because \"it will probably hit the enemy,\" or \"I think I could dodge it.\" Inconceivable, right?\r\n\r\nIf you watch her carefully, you will see that she has not been trained at all, and doesn't really have any of the basic skills that we drill into our soldiers. But she is able to make correct and effective decisions on the complicated and ever-changing battlefield with her instantaneous decision-making ability. We can't give her very high marks when it comes to \"combat proficiency,\" but her \"power\" is undeniable.\r\n\r\nAnd she's not too big on teaching others her \"combat skills,\" because instincts are hard to analyze. If her actions are based on instincts, then these \"skills\" can't really be taught, if you consider them skills at all...\r\n\r\nThe same goes for her craft. If you ask her about her designs, she will say that she \"thought it could probably work.\" It doesn't matter how good you are at comprehension, and it doesn't matter how motivated you want to become her apprentice because, at the end of the day, her abstract designs will make you question your decision.\r\n\r\nSo far, no one but her has been able to understand her designs.": "text_cobalt_achieves_1",

  "This is what Astra Shelter said about Tsubasa:\r\n\r\nNo one knew where she came from. That wasn't rare, but she stood out from the others that were around her age when she arrived.\r\n\r\nNot many at the shelter remember Tsubasa these days. When asked, they only say that she left quietly, and that there were no indications that she was going to leave. In one of the testimonials about her last days at the shelter, she was happily sharing food from her hunting trips with everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a winter day, a wandering girl came to the shelter. Since the shelter routinely helped out rovers, it was routine and almost didn't have to be recorded. But some said that her reason for joining was... eccentric.\r\n\r\nNo one remembers what happened exactly. She was so frail and skinny, as if no one took care of her. It was difficult to imagine how she managed to survive on Astra, where bandits and thieves ruled. Her hair was a mess and covered half of her face, but her eyes shone.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then she asked a simple, straightforward, and innocent question.\r\n\r\n\"Between you guys, the Hyenas, and the Ravagers, who's the strongest on this island?\"": "text_hane_achieves_1",
  "This is what Hykros said about Tsubasa:\r\n\r\n\"Her test results were great, even better than some that started Executor training at a young age. But during the application process, we found two... non-critical problems. They didn't stop her from being admitted, but we decided to give her a longer training and observation period, instead of assigning her to a team right away.\" These were from the evaluations by her proctor, who went into detail about the two \"non-critical problems.\"\r\n\r\nFirst, her body temperature is lower than others. Abnormally low.\r\n\r\nSecond, her last name sounded like she came from a noble family, but that didn't fit her. Could it be a fake name?\r\n\r\nEither way, it wouldn't have been difficult for her to become an Executor, because her physical prowess and intelligence were both dramatically above the average for people her age. More importantly, her survival and hunting skills demonstrated during the evaluation were off the charts.\r\n\r\nThe proctor was expecting a grand answer, something along the lines of agreeing with ideals or visions about the future, when he asked her, \"you don't look like you're troubled, and you can do more than just fine with your skills. So why do you want to join Hykros?\"\r\n\r\nShe said, \"no reason in particular, I just want to be where it's buzzing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe betrayed Hykros shortly after her observation period ended.": "text_hane_achieves_3",
  "This is what the Hyenas said about Tsubasa:\r\n\r\nShe quickly joined the group, and rose through the ranks as fast as lightning. This was not solely due to her talents, but also her... social skills, which were a natural fit in the Hyenas, where everyone hung out freely.\r\n\r\nShe left without any lingering emotional attachments, but she also left a lot of traces behind, more so than any other place she stayed. After all, she did share what was on her mind with some acquaintances.\r\n\r\nFor example, when she was explaining archery to the Hyena archers, she said, \"because of gravity and wind, no arrow flies straight. So for an archer, the most important ability is to make friends with gravity and wind, and feel them to get better at firing arrows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf one projects her values and experiences onto this quote, one might come to the conclusion that she was also talking about interpersonal relationships. People are like arrows, and no one is able to remain the same throughout their life, as they will be influenced by the environment they are in. So it's very important to figure out the environment, figure out what they want, and predict where this world might be headed.\r\n\r\nShe is the best example of these values. However, it will be a long, long time before we can see the results of her predictions.": "text_hane_achieves_2",

  "For the owner of this Simulacrum, we'd like to say this at first - KING is very different from others.\r\n\r\nWe've wanted to add this famous mercenary to our database since the beginning, but he didn't cross paths with Hykros, and we had no way of contacting him, since that required connections that we didn't have. After much string-pulling, we managed to contact him through an engineer we worked with, and finally got a chance to negotiate... or rather, strike a deal with him.\r\n\r\nHe didn't want anything that Hykros provided—long-term benefits, point of contact, further services, proof of friendship—none whatsoever. He wanted cash, and that was non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nSo we paid him a handsome amount for us to take his data for the Simulacrum. This amount still sticks out like a sore thumb in our accounting records.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we think KING is purely motivated by money, and this is completely reflected in the AI of the Simulacrum. Please don't think that he would help just because your interests aligned. Without money, it's difficult to make him do anything.\r\n\r\nStrange, isn't it? He pretty much wins every fight he's involved in, but you'll find that he doesn't always enter battles willingly. Why is that? Is it because battles don't have the same fun and sense of accomplishment? Or... is it because he measures everything with money, and not those intangible emotions? \r\n\r\n\r\n- Hykros Simulacrum Research Department": "text_king_achieves_1",
