  "That being said, I'm impressed that you two managed to fix the machine! Saved me a lot of trouble.": "TK-002-1083",

  "However, everyone's in this super important meeting in Mirroria... I think they're discussing the best response to the Grayspace Entities. I'm just here as part of your welcoming committee!": "TK-peppa-V004",
  "But exposing these important Strongholds with such fanfare, could it perhaps be a cover-up for something else...": "TK-002-2110",
  "The biggest suspect is still the Heirs of Aida. The notebook you found notes their local hideouts, and there's quite a lot.": "TK-002-2010",

  "However, it looks like he ain't going anywhere for a while...": "TK-403-4011",
  "But he didn't have much to start with. Given the limitations of present Omnium research, it's impossible to recreate most of the prototypes.": "npc_book6_317",

  "However, the materials needed for construction will have to be collected from the exploration areas out there.": "TK-207-1098",
  "But both our research on Crystamax and fields have a long way to go.": "TK-V117-p103",

  "It's just a simple wish, but it'll take a lot of work to make it come true...": "v60400-TK-107-010",
  "But I never thought I'd have the pleasure of working with you.": "TK-V109-p106",

  "But the consumption of the power generation equipment is increasing.": "TK-V114-P113",
  "However, even with Hykros' algorithm system, trying to find those segments is not something that can be done overnight, and it will take some time until the running is completed.": "TK-104-6011",

  "No, not Shirli... but the crazed persona locked inside her!": "TK-313-3036",
  "No, I'm here to ask for Mr. Kim's assistance in shutting off the Omnium Tower that somehow got activated.": "TK-player-4032_f",

  "They seemed to be plotting something, but I couldn't make out what they were saying...": "TK-player-2143_f",
  "They went to the top of the tower all by themselves. There were only a few guards and technicians here, so the Heirs of Aida took the opportunity to strike. We were outnumbered...": "TK-002-6006",

  "They're just using you!": "TK-option-105",
  "They seem to be looking for a very important item on the island, but I don't know what it is. Oh, did you get the intelligence?": "TK-002-5045",
  "They are collecting large amounts of organic metal, which is unusual. I'll report back to Hykros later.": "TK-002-2108",

  "They're retreating, but I cannot just spare them.": "TK-001-1034",
  "They're very agitated. Why don't we find Giggs and find out?": "TK-cici-4004",

  "What happened to him?": "TK-player-1196_f",
  "What happened to him? Has the injury gotten worse?": "TK-marc-35",

  "He's worried about you.": "npc_book5_542",
  "He's eccentric and might not welcome you in... But he should be willing to discuss vehicles with you through the intercom.": "npc_book6_321",
  "He's a role model for many researchers.": "npc_book3_812",
  "He's my friend, Franz. He's one of the good guys.": "TK-player-5007_f",

  "He didn't make it?": "TK-player-2177_f",

  "He was taken by the Heirs of Aida. I couldn't get my hands on him.": "TK-player-4098_f",
  "He said it tasted good? And ordered more too? Heh, what a foreign simpleton.": "TK-2006-1018",
  "He's talking about me...": "TK-option-086",
  "He's still wounded, so he can't have gotten far. The footprints seem to end around here. Let's take a look around, quickly.": "TK-503-5019",
  "He lied to me... that lunatic! He... cough...": "TK-001-4002",

  "Director Eva, we've got some questions.": "TK-player-V004",
  "We have some questions, Director Eva.": "TK-player-V004_f",
  "We're hoping to gather some Omnium, Director Eva. Ms. Shelly said you might be able to help?": "TK-010-V025",

  "I believe you know the name, Eason Hunter?": "TK-002-1168",

  "Didn't Mr. Eason tell you about me?": "TK-player-1107_f",
  "Mr. Eason wanted me to tell you the plan is proceeding smoothly. Just wait for the order, and don't do anything extraneous.": "TK-player-1106_f",
  "Is eveything ready, Mr. Eason? This project must succeed. Failure is not tolerated.": "TK-player-1094_f",
  "Eason told me you only looked like a child, but I didn't expect...": "TK-player-1121_f",
  "Eason planted three explosives in the lobby and on top of the dome. I didn't manage to disarm them all in time.": "TK-player-1315_f",
  "Eason was summoned back to headquarters to implement the next step in the plan, so he wanted us on standby in Hykros.": "TK-player-1141_f",
  "Eason was summoned back to headquarters to implement the next step in the plan, so he wanted us on standby in Hykros. Our conversation ends here. Please maintain your cover to ensure the project's success.": "TK-player-1137_f",

  "Prioritize the highest principles... Protect... home...": "TK-812-1021",

  "Is it too much trouble for you?": "TK-cobalt-1033",
  "It will be fine.": "npc_book3_704a",
  "Calamity follows closely in the trail of Calamity Star. Considering the damage it causes to Vera's environment, I think the name is quite suitable.": "TK-V250-055",
  "Does it look too cumbersome? The sacrifice has to be made in exchange for the power though.": "TK-cobalt-1018",
  "Will there be damage?": "TK-option-269",
  "He will be fine, Ms. Diana. The symptoms of his disease do come back from time to time.": "npc_book3_602",

  "The Bethlehem's defense is secured, but a large wave of Ravagers are attacking the shelter's front gates.": "TK-001-1017",
  "Server? You're the administrator for this tower?": "TK-player-1262",
  "Server? You're the admin for this tower?": "TK-player-1262_f",
  "Server? What can you do for me?": "TK-player-1068_f",
  "Makes sense. But why did you think it would be me?": "v60400-TK-player-030",
  "Makes sense. But why did you think it would be me?_f": "v60400-TK-player-030_f",
  "It seems urgent.": "TKS-Vplayer-011_f",
  "It seems they intend to use it to travel back to before the Cataclysm. Whatever they have planned... it's something big.": "TK-002-5051",
  "The spacerift's locating system must be off. I got sent next to a beehive.": "TK-010-1052",
  "But <blue>upgrading a suppressor</> costs a lot of resources. That's why you can only access a few functions right now.": "TK-010-1104",
  "But that was only the first step. The Heirs of Aida are still lurking in the shadows. Shutting down the other four towers won't be that easy.": "TK-002-1127",
  "But we have to restore order here as soon as possible. Please inform Mr. Kim that we've driven back the Hyenas.": "TK-4072-4002",
  "However, please beware that this temporary spacerift will only allow a single person to travel through at any given time and will need to be recharged after each use.": "v21TK-V122-0014",
  "But I'm tired, so I'm going to get some rest now... Play with me next time, alright? Buh-bye!": "TK-904-1010",
  "However, according to the information I collected earlier on, the operational state of the Omnium Tower seems to be abnormal. We need to make adequate plans after carrying out a field investigation.": "TK-002-5004",
  "For a time, that kept him at bay... But once he met Karl and the two started working together, it was not long before they both came to me with the same request... Which I ultimately approved.": "q204011_00_13",
  "When they were examining it, who knows what happened, and the machine activated. Then...": "TK-311-3025",
  "But he couldn't make it. He had to leave the information at the place we agreed to meet, on the abandoned tower in the Rusty Belt.": "TK-002-5040",
  "But as the organizer and the leader of an entire research station, well... I guess it isn't that easy to understand how things work, or should I say that we're at different levels...": "TK-V102-p101",
  "But you treasure those memories too, don't you?": "TK-player-2220_f",
  "But while you were away, a strange man came looking for you.": "TK-501-5009",
  "You can try to get him to tell you where the drugs are being produced. If he doesn't want to oppose Hykros, he should relent.": "TK-002-4021",
  "Your next opponent, Steel Fist Max! He's no pushover and had won multi-champion here. Look at those fans of his there!": "TK-0024-1010",
  "But, be warned, your own consciousness might be susceptible to her influence, driving you crazy. If that happens... I will have no choice but to destroy your physical bodies.": "TK-313-3039",
  "But tough luck. Your two other opponents are the infamous Brutal Brothers. They're something else.": "TK-0024-1014",
  "Beware, their usual tactic is to team up against the third competitor to ensure one of them will win the prize.": "TK-0024-1015",
  "(sighs) Unfortunately, despite her exceptional capabilities, her personality leaves much to be desired.": "TK-101-1051",
  "But recently, we've noticed that its appetite is too strong. The herbivores in its habitat are on the brink of extinction due to its preying behavior.": "TK-V250-074",
  "Since we all know what the Confounding Abyss has in store for us, Mirroria cannot turn a blind eye to the risks this may bring, so I will not be investing too much manpower and resources in this project.": "v21TK-V103-0036",
  "It was abandoned after the Cataclysm. Who knows what's down there, if you're going in, be careful.": "TK-002-1162",
  "But as you can see, we're facing many difficulties. The Heirs of Aida are planning something, and the issues with the Omnium Towers need to be resolved urgently.": "TK-102-1035",
  "In any case, if you're looking to place bets right now, I'm afraid it's not possible. Only our regular clients are allowed to bet on the competitions. It's one of our most sacred rules.": "TK-0051-1004",
  "But if it's sealed... I'm sorry, but I can only send people to clear it one bit at a time.": "TK-401-4040",
  "But if Ms. Lin wanted to hide this from us, she could've sent Shirli and me away and taken care of it herself.": "v21TK-player-V002",
  "But if Miss Lin wanted to hide this from us, she could've sent Shirli and me away and taken care of it herself.": "v21TK-player-V002_f",
  "Let me tell you something, unlike us, the Sage actually has high hopes for you.": "TK-314-1015",
  "Even so, they are still... so, I am still a little worried.": "TK-010-1186",
  "But Franz has been informed that the Heirs of Aida are carrying out operations in the Astra region.": "TK-player-5036_f",
  "But unfortunately, I misplaced it inside the ruins in the mountains on my last expedition. So if you can retrieve it...": "TK-2006-1023",
  "But unfortunately, the fusion technology for Originum was loss in the Cataclysm, so Hykros has been trying to find and recover these objects.": "TK-002-1118",
  "But unfortunately, after the Cataclysm, the technology to produce it was lost. It won't be easy to find a complete piece of Astrum.": "TK-002-1176",
  "Unfortunately, I searched everywhere around the shelter and failed to find any wild plant that fulfills that need.": "TK-001-1012",
  "Yes, but it's a shame that this Abyssant didn't have the Crystamax. I hope Larsen won't be too disappointed.": "TK-V107-0063",
  "But there are many things that can still be vaguely understood...": "TK-010-1222",
  "I'm sorry, though. I'm afraid I can't help you. As you see, we can't even protect ourselves right now.": "TK-501-5004",
  "I hope they will be able to live well.": "TK-V114-P122",
  "Let's hope so...": "TK-option-079",
  "B-But I can't do it alone! Hilda... can you please, please—": "TK-Food001-1003",
  "But we wasted fifty whole years on it, child! One foolish act set us back fifty whole years!": "TK-101-1018",
  "Yet I'm still not sure where Mr. Kim stands. Demanding Giggs out of him will only exacerbate our position.": "TK-002-4029",
  "But listen to me, there are people waiting for you in the Omnium Tower, so watch your back.": "TK-313-3081",
  "But my people don't have the prowess to retrieve it, so it's up to you.": "TK-313-3025",
  "But I found this.": "TK-option-137",
  "But I won't go back with him! My dad will have to come himself this time and agree to my demand!": "npc_book5_515",
  "But I know what to do. See those water cores over there? We'll use one as our new prism!": "TK-010-1174",
  "I bet there's something super important in there. Hykros specially sent <blue>Franz</> here just to investigate it.": "TK-010-1058",
  "All I can do is look back on these things, and express my gratitude for the little time we spent together.": "q204014_00_10",
  "But I've detected that another spacetime rift has opened nearby. I don't know how it's looking, however, and there's no backup in the area.": "TK-V108-0004",
  "I think he might be hiding something from me, but I couldn't figure out what it was.": "TK-player-4054_f",
  "But I still got to fix the energy converter, so can you <blue>inspect 5 lanterns</> for me?": "TK-215-1003",
  "But it's urgent to fix the converter, so can you check the lanterns? Just 5 of them will do.": "TK-karasuma-2003",
  "However, these are but contingencies and responses to an emergency incident. We need to prevent similar situations from taking place in the future.": "v21TK-V103-0005",
  "But these are all hypotheses. We'll have to wait for Dr. Rubilia to regain her consciousness to be sure. Before that, she could only relay information to us via her shared consciousness with Ruby.": "v21TK-V122-0036",
  "However, Technician Buru has detected a potential spacetime fluctuation near the research station, which could possibly affect the whole area.": "TK-V101-0003",
  "But I'm still charging you for the time you hang me out to dry. As usual, you'll pay for my overtiming.": "TK-KING-1023",
  "But the collectors have limited capacity, so check regularly.": "TK-207-1058",
  "But you're right. I'll try to change my approach.": "v60400-TK-108-017",
  "But according to my colleagues, none of her previous assistants was able to hold on. It didn't take long for them to pull in their horns. It sounds scary...": "TK-251-1004",
  "But that's not how I feel! You can't be evil simply to survive!": "npc_book5_525",
  "But it seems that the investigation of the information of desert creatures in Vera has been completed?": "TKS-Vplayer-009_f",
  "Even so, I have no right to say any of this to Claire. Not from my position, at least.": "q204013_00_06",
  "But to be honest, the Grayspace Entities have been attacking constantly and it is quite dangerous to collect materials outside... That's why the information in the museum display hasn't been updated in a long time.": "TK-V250-007",
  "But... this unpredictable existence with unperceivable effects is really fascinating...": "TK-V116-p102",
  "However, has anyone thought about where these native creatures that have adapted to the desert conditions will go when the time comes...?": "TK-V250-017",
  "Once a Crystamax is removed from an Abyssant's body, however, they start to lose their bioactivity. These three samples have already lost their value for research, and we need some fresh samples to complete our study.": "TK-V103-0009",
  "Recently, thanks to the Grayspace Entities' incursions growing out of control, we have become unable to guarantee the security of the facility. Larsen is actively considering relocating key equipment and personnel back to Headquarters.": "TK-V101-0012",
  "But I have a situation on hand, so I can't afford to spare anyone to deal with them...": "TK-401-4011",
  "But some sentiments are universal, right?": "TK-player-1152_f",
  "However, we lack eyes on the outside of Hykros' dome. I just received word that the third bomb has been found there.": "TK-104-1099",

  "But Ms. Bai Ling doesn't let anyone get close. The security cams in the warehouse ran out of juice a long time ago. No one knows what's going on in there.": "TK-226-5006",
  "Still, we have no way of safely investigating the area. That's why Mirroria locked down the entrance to the Confounding Abyss until now.": "v21TK-V107-0057",
  "But we will continue to rush to the front lines to do research on Grayspace Entities.": "TK-V101-p101",
  "It doesn't seem to be working...": "TK-player-1186_f",
  "But now... Shirli's become the Heirs of Aida's greatest bargaining chip. They want Zeke, and Zeke would do anything to save his sister...": "TK-002-1146",

  "But then someone shouted a warning about the Hyenas and everyone scattered.": "TK-218-1016",
  "But analysis revealed it was written forty years ago, so it's hard to track down any relevant info.": "npc_book_3_008",
  "But in terms of the results, the proposed requirements still deviate quite a bit from what was actually made. I don't know what to say about her...": "TK-V107-p105",

  "But to be clear, this is not an outing nor a sightseeing trip.": "TK-104-1113",
  "But this is more than being easy-going. Maybe he wants to make sure the festivities go smoothly, or he thinks it's part of the spirit of the day?": "TK-218-1034",
  "In no way does this mean they are weak. On the contrary, they are very powerful and not even the predators can easily hunt them. I'm sure you've experienced that to some extent...": "TK-V250-021",
  "However, we have no way of knowing if this also works on higher-level Abyssants and... what the end stage of this \"evolution\" would be.": "v21TK-V124-0025",
  "But the technology is still new, so we can't promise your body will accept it fully. Archon Elric will run a <blue>compatibility test</> on you. Get ready, because it won't be a walk in the park.": "TK-101-1026",
  "However, the application of this technology had to first overcome a very dangerous and imposing obstacle: namely, the compartmentalization of the subject's Simulacrum data, and the separation of physical and conscious data.": "TK-101-1063",

  "But the cannon hasn't been used in decades, and many of the parts are probably useless now... We'll have to find some replacement parts to repair it.": "TK-002-5013",
  "But first of all, we must investigate its biological characteristics and prepare in advance to minimize the occurrence of a calamity arising. That's exactly what we're going to do.": "TK-V250-058",

  "However, shutting off Omnium Tower is the pressing issue. Did you find the Astrum?": "TK-002-2031",

  "Good, you're here. So, did you find Theo and Mr. Kolador?": "TK-203-1073",

  "Ugh... He-he... I might have had a drink or two last night. I was just going to retrieve the environmental monitoring data.": "TK-003-1133",
  "Oh... Thanks a lot...": "TK-player-1230_f",
  "Hm? Looks like we have two new faces in our midst.": "v21TK-V124-0001",
  "Uh... Can I interrupt? Have you seen Dr. Claire from Cetus Island?": "TK-player-5031_f",
  "Uh... You came alone?": "TK-002-5037",
  "Uh... It's just the two of you?": "TK-002-1192",
  "Uh... Package?": "TK-player-1353_f",
  "Uh, I don't need to know all that. I just want to access the info on Astra's terrain.": "TK-player-1069_f",
  "Uh... M-My name is Huma...": "TK-1103-1006",
  "Uh... I used to be one. But I changed careers many years ago.": "npc_book3_713",
  "Err... You lost me.": "TK-player-1416_f",
  "Erm... What I'm saying is... there's still one step to take care of...": "TK-002-5020",
  "Erm... As per our agreement, I'll hang onto the Astrum for safekeeping—I'll return it once I've had a good look at it!": "TK-417-4021",
  "Er... Was it a tall, young girl with blonde hair?": "TK-1103-1017",
  "Uh... Yes! I saw her. She was taken to the glowing platform in the middle of the camp by a group of Heirs of Aida androids.": "TK-515-5007",
  "Yes, well... We aren't out of the woods yet. I dare not relax until we've successfully extracted the Crystamax. We won't need to bother you for any subsequent work, though, so you can leave that to us.": "TK-V115-0008",
  "Uh, now?": "TK-313-3013",
  "Er... Although... No, forget it. If we install the device here, I think other groups of gooseneck beasts will come here in the future.": "UI-vtalk-007",
  "Erm... It's obviously very powerful, but it's not all that stable. I'll have to find some time to improve it.": "TK-003-5009",
  "Uh, about that...": "npc_book_3_208",
  "Well... If you have to know, you better ask Elric.": "TK-002-1171",
  "Uh... It was my fault. When the probe was charged, I handed it to Mr. Charles, and waited for you to return upon completing your mission before turning on the dimensional passage.": "TK-101-1101",
  "Well, he knows me, and Hilda's too young and green, I bet that she can't even speak in front of that sly fox, so...": "TK-002-2022",
  "Ahem, so, uh... Press 1 for weather inquiries, 2 for task assignment, 3 for scheduling your revenge, and 4 if you want to treat me to lunch! Bye!": "TK-1103s-1002",
  "Yeah... You're right.": "q204006_02_15",
  "Well, guess I'll have to go check the square.": "npc_book6_416",
  "Uh, other than the ones guarding the basement, everyone else can go up.": "TK-hum-016-1002",
  "Well, the Hyenas got several different subsets... It can get confusing, so let's not go into that.": "npc_book5_414",
  "Oh, thanks...": "TK-player-2185_f",
  "Er, Ms. Cobalt-B?": "TK-player-1401_f",
  "Tell the truth.": "TK-025-1011",
  "Tell him about the mysterious person.": "TK-option-232",
  "Tell her... to take charge and... lead the shelter. I need... to rest for a while...": "TK-227-5005",
  "Give me the location.": "TK-player-4090_f",
  "Tell me, what must I do?": "TK-001-3016",
  "Please pass the drug out and make the crowd go away, so I can take you to my uncle.": "TK-402-4009",
  "It's not my place, Zeke, but Shirli might be more capable than you think. Maybe you can have a little more trust in her.": "TK-002-1084",
  "Wah...": "npc_book5_508",
  "Pelo... (sobs)": "npc_book3_608",
  "Sob... I was robbed and the dirigible is gone... What do I do now?": "TK-302-3001",
  "Sob... They got Melo and the dirigible is lost. What am I going to do?": "TK-302-3112",
  "Waaah! You're okay now, that's all that matters!": "TK-311-3075",
  "Ugh, I'll have to ask Lin after all...": "TK-V113-p106",
  "Hi ya, it's been a while. Did something happen again?": "npc_book4_201",
  "Hykros is looking for stuff on the black market now?": "npc_book_3_305",
  "Just some malfunctions in the transport system. The techs are on it now and should fix it soon, don't worry.": "TK-101-1027",
  "Ha ha ha! What a young Executor. Being young means that you have the extraordinary courage and determination required to do everything in your power to achieve your dreams.": "TK-V103-p101",
  "Hah, I guess she snuck off from embarrassment?": "TK-1104-1014",
  "I've lived here for decades. I can tell who's new and who's not. The eyes always give it away.": "TK-411-4002",
  "Heh, not only I am a failed husband, a failed father as well...": "TK-207-1018",
  "Ah! And I was just about to ask you for a small favor, as well! How fortunate.": "q204001_02_13",
  "Ha-ha-ha, young people these days truly surprise me.": "TK-207-1027",
  "Ha-ha-ha... It needs some time to take effect. Nevertheless, it's better than nothing, won't you agree?": "TK-401-4019",
  "Hmm... A famous machinist passed by not long ago. I bought a powerful mecha from him called the Destroyer... That thing wasn't cheap!": "TK-003-5006",
  "Well, you are indeed Commander of Lighthouse's Hunters.": "TK-baiyuekui-1023",
  "Oh, you... Stand in for them, then. I'm going up there.": "TK-hum-016-1004",
  "Heh! You're up against us in the next round. Too bad. The prize is ours! Heh-heh-heh!": "TK-0063-1001",
  "Humph, so it's Hykros again. I never bought into their whole \"saving the world\" spiel.": "TK-003-1060",
  "Ah, you're from Hykros, I see. No wonder. Pardon my manners.": "TK-207-1038",
  "Fine. We're both guests in someone else's house, so we better follow the rules.": "TK-314-3003",
  "I hate them all. Hykros pushed my father to his death, and the Heirs of Aida led my father down the path of no return.": "TK-001-5004",
  "You have to be mad.": "TK-chars-10",
  "Heh, I remember it was such a big project that took a long time to complete, and now you end up blocking yourself out.": "TK-KING-1027",
  "Winning the championship on your first try? That's really something. I would love to fight you.": "TK-KING-1019",
  "It's not fresh, but still too good for them monsters.": "TK-205-1012",
  "I should've never gotten involved in this mess in the first place...": "TK-313-3079",
  "We're not gonna stand for this! Giggs has been jerking us around long enough. He better have an answer for us all!": "TK-404-4006",
  "Ahh...": "v60400-TK-106-040",
  "Phew, finally, the peons are gone... That was a chore.": "TK-402-4010",
  "If it's the embarrassing stories of your childhood with Flora, then it would go on for at least three days.": "TK-1104-1013",
  "Whoo, that should do it.": "TK-cobalt-1021",
  "Phew, that was close, but we made it.": "TK-302-3078",
  "Sending command...": "TK-121-1013",
  "Heirs of Aida?": "npc_book_3_006",
  "You can talk to them before the match, but I'm warning you, don't start anything.": "TK-KING-1018",
  "Like you, the agents are all regular people. But with \"gene lock,\" they gain abilities beyond normal humans to deal with the most treacherous of perils.": "TK-104-1006",
  "Your opponents are the Brutal Brothers. They've got a trick or two up their sleeves.": "TK-KING-1015",
  "When I'm with you, some... courage, will emerge in my heart.": "TK-010-1224",
  "Who was that with Zeke?": "TK-player-1276_f",
  "Talk to Fred": "npc_book_2_005",
  "It is just as I anticipated—the Hyenas are responsible for the theft. I assume the goods have already been handed over to their leader, the irritable Lady Lucia.": "TK-401-4026",
  "Just as I predicted. It's completely disabled.": "TK-cobalt-1053",
  "What should we do now? We've seen Uncle Kolador, but I don't think Harriet's noodles will be ready yet.": "TK-203-1143",
  "Talk to the elderly man next to the laptop": "npc_book_2_001",
  "Huh... Right here will do?": "TK-player-1533_f",
  "Meryl? What is she doing here?": "UI-v60400-player-003",
  "Meryl? What is she doing here?_f": "UI-v60400-player-003_f",
  "Are you a friend of Mr. Elric?": "npc_book_3_002",
  "Oh... Who are you?": "TK-515-5003",
  "Huh, I didn't expect to see anyone behind the Omnium Tower.": "npc_book_101",
  "Hm?": "v60400-TK-player-075",
  "Huh? Why can't you speak, Mi-a?": "TK-V113-0008",
  "What? But that's a Hyena stronghold...": "npc_book_2_106",
  "Who are you? Are you here to help us?": "TK-302-3004",
  "Where did you go? I saw you rushing out of the port.": "TK-203-1091",
  "Hey, where's our young lady?": "npc_book5_601",
  "Huh? Y-yes. What a coincidence. Are you looking for her?": "TK-251-1002",
  "Oh. Well if it isn't little Shirli. It's unlike Zeke to let you come this far out.": "TK-002-1075",
  "Huh? Harriet the Crybaby?": "TK-203-1030",
  "Let's get it done as soon as possible. I don't want to stay here a second longer.": "TK-302-3080",
  "Let's take the balloon somewhere safer. Hanna, come and take a look at this...": "TK-302-3024",
  "Saki, how's Ruby?": "v21TK-V107-0039",
  "So, what's the situation here?": "TK-V107-0049",
  "So what's going on in there, Saki?": "TK-V107-0100",
  "Saki? What are you doing here? Aren't you on city duty today?": "TK-V107-0046",
  "Ahem...": "TK-chars-01",
  "Cough... I'm fine, but the Hyenas made an ugly mess here. I'm ashamed to face Mr. Kim...": "TK-409-4003",
  "Cough... Did Bai Ling send you? Is the shelter okay?": "TK-227-5001",
  "Cough... I don't think I have time to rest. I... cough, cough... have to repair the tracks to make sure things get around.": "TK-409-4007",
  "Ahem, don't look at me like that. It's very impolite. My daily tasks are...": "TK-574-1005",
  "Ahem! Ahem! Cough! Cough! Cough!": "TK-1103-1083",
  "Ahem, I can't appear flustered now. This is the time to show my professionalism.": "TK-V105-p101",
  "(sighs) Well, I was actually kind of hoping your way would work...": "v60400-TK-109-007",
  "It mentioned in Schudy's report that you experienced an energy resonance with Meryl's data and established a certain degree of connection to her memory...": "TK-101-1043",
  "Wow... Me and Dolly can't imagine how far away that is.": "TK-V113-p102",
  "Woah... Well, that makes sense.": "TK-203-1146",
  "You don't hold back, do you?": "v60400-TK-111-016",
  "Beautiful moves! Thanks!": "TK-203-1080",
  "Whoa... This kid... has quite a temper...": "TK-313-3033",
  "You teamed up against me? Good thing I didn't fall for it.": "v60400-TK-111-010",
  "Oh, thank you so much! Isn't it just adorable, though it's a bit naughty?": "TK-145-1009",
  "Wow... How did you do that? Is there a secret sequence of buttons to press?": "TK-player-1361_f",
  "Woah, that fish smells yummy!": "TK-010-1172",
  "Whoa! I can't believe someone was able to solve my impossible riddles! Leave your name, won't you?": "TK-1103s-1012",
  "Hmph! I wouldn't have been if it wasn't to save you! You're the one who got caught first.": "TK-1103s-V014",
  "Hi, Hanna... Whaaat can I do for you?": "TK-304-3001",
  "Ha... It's okay. Just let me handle this.": "TK-player-1526_f",
  "Well, please get ready and leave everything else to me!": "TK-302-3084",
  "I should quit nagging now. Time for me to go.": "npc_book_2_412",
  "Ha-ha-ha, just kidding. Just treat it as a commission from Hykros, and we'll compensate you.": "npc_book4_212",
  "Hee, he taught me how to put up a tent when I was seven or eight. He said it's an essential skill I'll find useful someday. Dad helped him show me too.": "npc_book5_822",
  "Ha-ha-ha, my name is <blue>Braun</>, a historian.": "npc_book_102b",
  "Sorry, I was just making small talk. My name is <blue>Braun</>, a historian.": "npc_book_102a",
  "The fact you got a glib tongue means you're not a typical Hykros stiff.": "npc_book_3_331",
  "Ha-ha-ha! Special Agent, are you suspecting that I, too, am connected with the Heirs of Aida?": "TK-401-4047",
  "Oh, that's easy. See that <blue>switch</> over there? Flip it and see how well you did.": "TK-215-1005",
  "Oh, that's easy. See that switch over there? Flip it and see how well you did.": "TK-karasuma-2005",
  "Hah! The bad guys are all asleep!": "TK-302-3022",
  "Haha! Look who it is!": "TK-903-1001",
  "You're not still hungry, are you? Guess being a hero isn't all it's cracked up to be.": "TK-002-1005",
  "Ha-ha, you're not in our field, so you don't know about Dr. Fenyr.": "npc_book3_809",
  "And... as you must've guessed, that merchant is Mr. Kolador. Everything we have in Banges is literally owed to him!": "TK-203-1017",
  "Don't insult my intelligence.": "npc_book_3_306",
  "Ha-ha, I'm just curious, don't mind me. Anyway, the upgrade has been successful! The water heater and air purification system have been turned on, and you're good to go! Have a good rest.": "TK-V119-0005",
  "I guess there are things I don't understand. Well, come on, I'll take you to the doctor.": "TK-302-3042",
  "Ha-ha! The lone hero triumphs! I can settle my own commission with Mr. Kim": "TK-417-4020",
  "Heh, you obviously know who I am, but I know nothing about you. This ain't fair.": "TK-2006-1007",
  "Ha-ha! Then we have a deal!": "TK-V105-0005",
  "Ha, ha, I think everyone's views and requirements for mechanical products are different.": "TK-player-1425_f",
  "Is that so?": "v60400-TK-111-018",
  "Hah! We've had so many visitors here recently. Cetus Island hasn't been this busy in such a long time.": "TK-302-3029",
  "Yes, we can travel through the dam!": "TK-302-3059",
  "Deal! Let's start with the simplest step.": "TK-401-4012",
  "Ha-ha! Great... I'll recharge the mecha now. You can help me to startup the energy device.": "TK-417-4019",
  "You do look too young to know how it works.": "npc_book6_106",
  "A-ha! Thanks for your effort.": "npc_book_2_405a",
  "No dancing around, I see.": "npc_book_3_315",
  "Heh, that's always been a topic of discussion.": "npc_book6_122",
  "I... I hid well enough, but the two aberrants... That was scary!": "TK-302-3106",
  "I... feel dizzy...": "TK-302-5002",
  "I will! Thank you, Mr. Housekeeper!": "TK-302-3052",
  "Hello, Hanna. My name is Mi-a. We are here to see Dr. Claire regarding important issues.": "TK-cici-3010",
  "Are you okay, Hanna?": "TK-player-3084_f",
  "All I can do is help the doctor shoulder some of her burdens.": "q204005_01_11",
  "The carousel has been fully repaired! Would you like to come see it?": "q204006_02_24",
  "Hanna really worries about the doctor, huh...": "q204006_00_p",
  "Perhaps one of their camps still has some parts we could use...": "q204005_03_04",
  "I'd like to ask you to help recover the provisions. Those boxes are too big and hard for me to open!": "TK-302-3011",
  "It feels weird here... The air is thick with the stench of aberrants...": "TK-302-3107",
  "I know who you are! I can still recall that stench of yours!": "TK-302-3086",
  "Is Hanna your creator? Or master, maybe?": "TK-cici-3004",
  "I saw them stuff a lot of the supplies into boxes and put them on the path to their stronghold.": "TK-302-3010",
  "All I know is that remembering Dr. Luhn always causes the doctor much pain.": "q204005_01_07",
  "I can hear the bad guys. There's a lot of them, and they don't sound human...": "TK-302-3088",
  "I remember once, when the doctor was drunk, she spent the entire night muttering Dr. Luhn's name.": "q204005_01_04",
  "Hanna told me you fight well so I've got just the task for you.": "TK-313-3023",
  "That's right, Hanna!": "TK-option-103",
  "I will complete the repairs soon. In the meantime, could you please ask the doctor to come and take a look?": "q204006_00_03",
  "Hanna! Don't! Cry! Melo! Get! Big Fellow! Help!": "TK-301-1026",
  "Hanna! Where!": "TK-301-1024",
  "Hanna! Nowhere! Melo! To the island! Report! Doctor!": "TK-301-1012",
  "Hanna! Yes! Hanna!": "TK-301-1006",
  "Hanna is, Hanna! Master is, Doctor!": "TK-301-1007",
  "Hanna! Melo found! Hanna!": "TK-301-1025",
  "Hanna, you're back. What took you so long?": "TK-313-3001",
  "Hanna, are you okay?": "TK-player-5027_f",
  "Hanna, would you lead the guest there?": "TK-313-3011",
  "Are my tools ready, Hanna?": "q204004_00_01",
  "Is Hanna your creator or muhster... mustard... master?": "TK-Mi-a-1045",
  "Hanna? You mean the other kid? She was, uh, taken to Base Two. Oh, that's where the dirigible is, too!": "TK-311-3016",
  "Hanna? Was she with you?": "TK-player-3006_f",
  "Harriet is no kid anymore, so he's in charge of his own shop this year. He should be right below.": "TK-218-1006",
  "Harriet's place is starting to look very professional. I'll have to keep an eye on him.": "TK-203-1133",
  "Ha! Ha! Ha! Not bad! Not bad indeed...": "TK-903-1008",
  "There are so many things you don't know yet. The world doesn't stop even when life kicks you down to the ground.": "TK-001-1029",
  "Nice one. So all of you decide to play the innocent card after the big culprit is gone?": "TK-313-3073",
  "That'll be all. A new round is about to begin. You should join the spectators.": "TK-0024-1006",
  "Yay, it's working! But the rain is rather unexpected, so we've got to hurry!": "TK-010-1088",
  "Ha, itching for a fight? Get ready, because you're next.": "TK-KING-1008",
  "Hey, the explorer is back.": "TK-2006-1024",
  "Ha! Doesn't a good fight just stir the blood in your veins? Are you ready? You're next!": "TK-0024-1007",
  "Huh? Could it be that you came here on a whim to get this because you owe someone an urgent delivery?": "TK-KING-1038",
  "Come on, don't get yourself in a funk. It will get better.": "TK-203-1114",
  "Oh... I found you, I guess.": "TK-503-5014",
  "Uh oh... Now that's embarrassing...": "TK-1103s-V007",
  "There you are, Honored Guest! How are you feeling?": "TK-302-3043",
  "Oh my! Hurry!": "TK-904-1001",
  "Oops, I seem to have forgotten.": "TK-2006-1021",
  "Hey, don't put it like that! Let me explain it to you first...": "TK-V250-004",
  "Oh, you're here!": "TK-002-6016",
  "Well, it's a big machine that I can't use, so I sold it...": "npc_book_3_210",
  "Oh no, we can talk about this later. Go back to Dr. Fenyr. The patient must be waiting.": "npc_book3_813",
  "Moan...": "TK-408-4001",
  "Hold on right there! I'm not cleaning up after you. No way!": "TK-203-1033",
  "Ughh...": "TK-V105-p100",
  "Oh, what's this? The gooseneck beasts look a little off. Do they think you're setting a trap?": "UI-vtalk-008",
  "Oh wow, Palu. YOU know how to stop it?": "TK-002-1031",
  "This is why it's scary. A while ago, Franken sent someone to steal something... like a machine from that woman doctor.": "TK-311-3024",
  "Eh? H⁠-Hilda? Is that really you?": "TK-Food001-1001",
  "Ratatatatata! I won! Heh-heh-heh!": "TK-904-1005",
  "Beep... Self-repair initiated, energy saving mode engaged.": "TK-huasheng-1008",
  "Beep... Beep...": "npc_book_3_401",
  "Nothing like some brand-new clothes, am I right?": "TK-013-1006",
  "Hey, isn't it Franz? But I don't remember inviting you.": "TK-313-3067",
  "Brother, where are we now?": "TK-V106-p104",
  "He was unsure about it for quite a while, but accepted it in the end.": "v60400-TK-106-008",
  "Zeke's busy, so here I am! We need a favor.": "TK-010-1069",
  "Zeke, I...": "TK-010-1094",
  "This person was all bruised up and passed out in the mountain. Probably a lost scavenger.": "TK-010-1023-1",
  "Oh... sorry. I'm not exactly the talkative type.": "TK-417-4002",
  "Oh... By the way, after the attack by the Heirs of Aida, our medicine is now low. Could you help us find some medical supplies?": "TK-501-5020",
  "How do you do, my guest. Slayer at your service.": "TK-304-3004",
  "Oh, you're back. Where is it?": "TK-313-3061",
  "Oh, I forgot, I have a very vital piece of information! Take me to Cetus Island and if the doctor will offer me a shelter, I'll give you the info!": "TK-311-3043",
  "Ohhhh, everything is good! All debugged and dormant, just waiting for you. Come with me!": "TK-V105-0030",
  "Oh, by the way, news about the boy named Pelo: his surgery was successful. He's been sent home to recover.": "npc_book4_215",
  "Oh, the screen on that machine is broken, so I found a replacement. Mind bringing it to him for me?": "npc_book_3_216",
  "Oh, Blake is a cute little black kitty cat. Kitties are the most adorable animals, don't you agree? So you'll help, right?": "TK-145-1004",
  "Oh, I almost forgot. Yesterday I applied for indefinite stay permission at your accommodation. Just go to the front desk, register your info and you'll be all set.": "TK-V107-0070",
  "You're here, too! I really think we'll put on a perfect show!": "v60400-TK-108-001",
  "Oh no, I'm not a doctor.": "npc_book3_712",
  "OK, he should be near the main gate of the shelter. If they wanna find them, go quickly. I'll stay here and check if there are any valuable clues nearby.": "TK-003-5011",
  "Oh, you... You were sent to escort me, right? I didn't expect they'd send someone so young.": "TK-603-6003",
  "So, you're the one they rescued from outside.": "TK-013-1046",
  "You got the goods? Show me!": "TK-209-1001",
  "You work for him? You're looking for Astrum, right? How come I never saw you before?": "TK-2006-1006",
  "Oh, you made it. I was just explaining the situation to Palu.": "TK-002-1028",
  "Oh, you're here. I was just asking the owner about Samir.": "TK-1103-1015",
  "Oh, your friend Zeke is awake. He's been asking for you... You should go see him.": "TK-501-5023",
  "You must be hungry after all that tough work. Franz left his cooking pot here. Why don't you get yourself something to eat first?": "TK-010-1171",
  "Ahead is the District 7 Headquarters. Please, this way to Archon Larsen.": "TK-V104-0011",
  "Right, strong! Ahem. Other than plenty of protein, you must train. Did you happen to see any <blue>Hyenas</> peons when catching the fish? Okay, your first lesson is to fight them!": "TK-039-1009",
  "Oh, yes, and my name is Diana. He knows me.": "npc_book3_110",
  "Oh, no problem. I'll take a look on the way back.": "TK-002-1077",
  "It was just now, about half a minute. You should be able to catch up to her.": "TK-Food001-1008",
  "Oh, it's you! Yes! You are not only my cousin's savior—now, you're my savior, too!": "TK-515-5004",
  "Oh, you mean Ms. Diya.": "npc_book5_407",
  "Oh, almost forgot! I have a gift for you. Go pick it up when you have the time.": "TK-002-1110",
  "Oh! Almost forgot, here's your prize, the Astrum! All yours. It'll fetch a good price out there.": "TK-KING-1020",
  "Almost forgot... I still got some battery. <blue>Upgrade the suppressor</> now. It will come in handy later.": "TK-010-1114",
  "Oh. Does that mean Ruby wants to go see a concert?": "v60400-TK-player-003_f",
  "Oh, I get it. You want Astrum too, right?": "TK-313-3007",
  "Oh, let me introduce you. These two are Executor and Shirli from District 9. This is⁠—": "v21TK-V108-0012",
  "Oh, I know! I know! You're Shirli from Astra Shelter! I think it's my first time meeting someone from the Angel of Clemency...": "TK-203-1121",
  "You mean you can pay me however much I name?": "npc_book_3_328",
  "By the way, I got attacked by White Lightning on the beach. Luckily my new friends were there to save me!": "TK-203-1085-1",
  "Oh, there you are, Executor. The report Gerard gave me earlier mentioned that you were the first to contact Mr. Marc and Mr. Charles.": "TK-101-1094",
  "Oh! Greetings, Executor.": "TK-104-V002",
  "Oh, Executor... Zero has completed the upgrade to the Omnium extractor. It'll automatically follow you and help collect nearby Omnium.": "TK-V101-0022",
  "Oh, it's you...": "q204006_02_01",
  "Ah, a new face. Welcome to my business. What would you like?": "TK-2006-1001",
  "The thing is, Omnium reserves are scarce throughout the Vera region ever since the Tower of Fantasy shut down after the Cataclysm. But... You could try asking Director Eva. She might be able to help.": "TK-V105-0025",
  "Oh, another thing... Hilda is a good friend of Theo's. You saved her from White Lightning, so Theo asked me to thank you.": "TK-207-1034",
  "Oh, that. I just found the old machine sitting in the wild and discovered the data inside after hauling it home.": "npc_book_3_204",
  "Huh? So you also think it was trying to talk to us?": "TK-V107-0111",
  "Oh? You defeated White Lightning?": "TK-207-1026",
  "How about that! I like your attitude. Maybe I won't mess you up too badly.": "TK-0091-1004",
  "And you're his...?": "npc_book_3_303",
  "You manage to get this far?": "TK-314-3001",
  "Huh? You're confident, I'll give you that, but it takes a lot of energy to start up this Destroyer. Go and find some for me. There are lots of these things around here.": "TK-417-4011",
  "Oh? Hmm... Well, if it isn't my little Peach! Come here, let grandma take a good look at you...": "TK-1104-1001",
  "Elric never told you? I guess I'm not the only one who needs an answer.": "TK-313-3083",
  "Oh, it's you. Let me get to the point—this emergency communication channel won't stay up for long. The Heirs of Aida may soon realize I'm secretly contacting the outside...": "TK-313-5017",
  "Huh, a new face.": "TK-013-1017",
  "Really? It looks Giggs hid a lot of secrets up there behind my back.": "TK-401-4038",
  "So his enemy is getting ahead of him, and then, he remembers me. Unfortunately, even the most loyal dog would bite if it hurt too much.": "TK-313-3075",
  "Oh? Tell me.": "TK-313-3053",
  "Oh? Is that true? You... really lost your memories?": "TK-002-1166",
  "Oh? So how did you...": "TK-V107-0058",
  "Oh? Well, hopefully Dr. Clive will have more good news for us too!": "TK-V107-0092",
  "And who are you?": "npc_book4_603",
  "Who is it? I'm working.": "TK-cobalt-1009",
  "Even if it is a trap, we have to break in.": "TK-001-5027",
  "It's the best atmosphere to enjoy the festivities alone.": "TK-1103-1079",
  "From a philosophical perspective, even a glass of water being poured into a new glass could be questioned if it is still the same water.": "npc_book6_124",
  "Ha! I know what everyone is up to.": "v60400-TK-111-002",
  "Hmmm...": "TK-V111-p103",
  "Hmph! I'm really well-informed!": "TK-203-1122",
  "Heh. Yeah, that shut you up.": "TK-218-1029",
  "Hmph!": "TK-203-1075",
  "Humph. Don't be so surprised. I've no intention of causing any trouble.": "TK-218-1021",
  "You can't hit another, even in an argument! I don't like them!": "TK-302-3044",
  "Humph! I got my eyes on you. Just you wait!": "TK-0063-1004",
  "I'm ignoring you now, Melo. May I ask you for a favor, Honored Guest?": "TK-302-3007",
  "Hmph! Nonsense! Did you plan on zoning out by yourself here?": "TK-203-1053",
  "Yeah, I guess so.": "TK-player-3045_f",
  "I'll deal with him after I'm done with you... Just you wait!": "TK-0066-1003",
  "I have my sources for such information.": "v60400-TK-112-011",
  "Hmph! Stupid Melo... Let's go back to the island!": "TK-302-3031",
  "Well, it's nothing. It's just that I suddenly remembered how those things came about...": "TK-KING-1043",
  "Hmph, if it hadn't got the drop on me, there's no way... Whatever, let's just say I owe you one!": "TK-1103s-V015",
  "Hmph... You don't have to say sorry to me. If it were not for you, who'd want to look after a guy like that! Such a rude fool...!": "TK-503-5018",
  "Okay, I'm counting down!": "TK-010-1066",
  "Well...": "TK-vplayer-p211",
  "Ugh... I hate not knowing how long I'll have to wait...": "TK-peppa-V002",
  "Sigh. Maybe Inquisitor Klema has told you all about the boring ideals, but I just want to talk about something practical.": "TK-101-1008",
  "Pff, you're so tiresome... Listen... Let me keep the egg safe, you guys go explore...": "TK-1103s-V003",
  "(sighs) I take it you've seen the mess down there?": "TK-101-1046",
  "Hey... You're here...": "TK-203-1108",
  "I'm not saying you can't have some, but you have to do your job first.": "TK-218-1002",
  "You should feed yourself, instead, because you'll be doing the heavy lifting!": "TK-010-1082",
  "Ms. Lin... That's not a nice thing to say. I'm only here to help you complete the mission, that's all...": "v21TK-V124-0005",
  "She's alive, barely, but her body and consciousness is still in a deep coma, and getting more difficult to awake.": "TK-313-3021",
  "Rumor has it he'd steal poor ore to sell, but that's unproven since no one ever caught him.": "TK-411-4005",
  "Hmm... I hear Banges is a pretty busy place. I really want to see it for myself, but Uncle Chris said it would take a long time to get there.": "TK-412-4002",
  "Oh, fine... It's a fair deal, and Harriet can't complain about me bullying him again. Just drop the cargo off at the front of the store.": "TK-203-1034",
  "Well... alright. We shall go to Hykros and get to the bottom of this. It's also a great chance to see the rest of the world.": "TK-002-1024",
  "(sighs) Fine. I'll go fix the spacerift and come back to this later.": "TK-002-1181",
  "Oh... It's bad... bad bad bad!": "TK-V105-0018",
  "I understand... I should go talk to her.": "TK-001-1021",
  "I can let you go, but you best not be seen around here. If she ever catches you again...": "TK-player-3093_f",
  "Sigh... I'm so sad now. I thought I could rule the land with this old face.": "TK-002-5002",
  "I knew this would happen...": "TK-313-3042",
  "Argh... I can't even bear to think what it might look like in there now. It must be total chaos...": "TK-002-6018",
  "Ah... we still got a lot on the plate for today. Let's think about this tomorrow.": "TK-203-1112",
  "I really underestimated those lunatics. Never thought they would attack here...": "TK-207-1008",
  "Oh... It's my own issue.": "npc_book3_715",
  "Everyone wanted to come to the mine and make a fortune. Look at us now... broke and penniless.": "TK-413-4004",
  "Man... I really don't want to stay here a second longer than I have to.": "v21TK-V124-0012",
  "I better keep this from Harriet, so I don't break his heart. My poor brother...": "TK-218-1005",
  "Hmph! So who exactly was it?": "TK-003-1106",
  "Ah! Well, what's done is done. I'll need to tell everyone to prepare appropriately. Although I'm not sure what we can do.": "TK-218-1035",
  "Whoa, don't get hostile! Hear me out first!": "npc_book5_404",
  "Alas, my holiday has been ruined again before I knew it.": "TK-V105-p103",
  "Ugh, I'm definitely overthinking things... Let's head to the research facility; maybe we'll find the answers we're looking for there.": "TK-1103-1042",
  "I'll spend the night here. We'll see what tomorrow brings.": "npc_book5_824",
  "Same old you, everything's a secret. Yet you still want people to go out on a limb for you.": "TK-002-1165",
  "Man, all of you got hollow legs!": "TK-205-1008",
  "Oh no, you annoyed them! We'll have to wait until they calm down before we can collect the materials...": "UI-vtalk-004",
  "Oh, don't believe me? We should still bring him in for questioning, don't you think?": "TK-002-1170",
  "Hey, are you a friend of our young lady?": "npc_book5_401",
  "Alas, I tried to convince the boss too.": "npc_book5_617",
  "Alas, I understand how she feels, really.": "npc_book5_616",
  "Probably the bandits... They've been real active recently and must've scared the merchants off. Wonder when's President Kolador gonna do something about it.": "TK-203-1003",
  "Giggs lied to us. The Heirs of Aida set up a trap there.": "TK-player-4086_f",
  "Oh, Elric, leaving such an important job to us...": "TK-002-1029",
  "Who knows? It fell many miners, no one are willing to work now. Everyone is hoping the problem gets solved.": "TK-403-4004",
  "Haaah... Well, that's Franz for you. Forget it. His credit isn't too bad. Take it and I'll settle the payment with him later.": "TK-125-1007",
  "The boss is much more impatient than I am. He's been restless since she left.": "npc_book5_621",
  "Well... What happened back then...": "q204013_00_02",
  "So annoying... What do you want?": "npc_book_3_001",
  "Anyway, thank you. You should report back to Mr. Kim. I can take care of things here.": "TK-409-4011",
  "That's why I've been hesitant to tell Diana about this surgery.": "npc_book3_710",
  "(sighs) Returning to the subject at hand... I still have concerns whether the memory resonance between you and Meryl will somehow affect your body.": "TK-101-1079",
  "Ah, I knew I couldn't count on those old guys. No matter how much I give, they always have more important interests to protect.": "TK-002-5038",
  "Yeah, I get it, things are happening. I don't want trouble, and I can get what you want, but it's a two-way street.": "TK-2006-1010",
  "Well... You know I've said it before—fighting really isn't my forte. So... good luck with the Astrum hunting!": "TK-002-1150",
  "Of course. Regrets, however, will not change the present in any way... Our hearts may still cling to the past, but our resolve and decisions will always lead us forward.": "q204013_00_05",
  "(sighs) I was going to take a break, but since this is for the celebration... Why don't you come too!": "TK-203-1038",
  "Huh? Wait! Look over there... It looks like that little thing from Cetus Island!": "TK-311-3073",
  "Never mind. Since it's so urgent, I'll give priority to this Heavy System.": "TK-cobalt-1088",
  "You know, if shouting could get things done, I would be protesting with them long ago...": "TK-403-4009",
  "Staying alive is all that matters in times like these. Consider yourself lucky.": "TK-003-1081",
  "But I just can't leave in peace...": "npc_book5_629",
  "If that's the case, then you're outta luck. There probably isn't much to see this year.": "TK-203-1001",
  "Huh? Because you picked it up. A good person would finish it all the way!": "npc_book4_211",
  "Ugh...": "v60400-TK-107-022",
  "Uh... None of the assistants were here for long. Perhaps it's because of our difference in the style of creation?": "TK-cobalt-1026",
  "Uh, did you read it?": "npc_book_2_204",
  "Ah. So it's another bad guy! That is a vital discovery, I shall report to the doctor as soon as possible!": "TK-302-3109",
  "I'll work harder...": "v60400-TK-108-012",
  "I'd love to... But now's not the time.": "TK-010-1173",
  "Huh, didn't want anything to do with his brother... Guess they were on pretty lousy terms.": "npc_book4_703",
  "Well, someone should stay here to watch over things. Can you please go to the Astra Omnium Tower? There's a scrapper there. Ask it if we can borrow its backup power source.": "TK-010-1166",
  "Night fell... and then... I don't remember what happened. All I remember is it was dark... and cold...": "v21TK-V113-0004",
  "You need to get better at following the rhythm and staying in tune.": "v60400-TK-player-049",
  "You need to get better at following the rhythm and staying in tune._f": "v60400-TK-player-049_f",
  "Uh... I did promise to help repair the Heavy System, but I also have a lot of important work to do. According to my work schedule, it'll take another week before I can deliver it to you.": "TK-cobalt-1085",
  "Oh yes, the language module... I can certainly take a look, though I've never seen such a model as Mi-a before. Allow me to conduct an initial examination first.": "TK-V105-0009",
  "Umm, so, we have this little thing that we were hoping you could help out with.": "v60400-TK-107-045",
  "I... Well... Umm... I used it a couple of times, and I still feel like me!": "TK-010-1038",
  "Hmm... I may have a way to get this machine working again...": "TK-010-1165",
  "Well... The food over there is good, I'll grant you, but... I still feel like...": "TK-V105-0004",
  "Hmm. This is the first time I've seen such a design. It seems... intriguing.": "TK-cobalt-1094",
  "Mm, who might you be?": "TK-cobalt-1001",
  "Um, if I just work on this part a little...": "TK-cobalt-1095",
  "Awmmm...": "TK-cobalt-1080",
  "Hmph. I was just wondering if I'd get any work, and you showed up.": "v60400-TK-812-001",
  "Um, when the power of this part is increased, the corresponding pressure of the cooling module also increases, so...": "TK-cobalt-1014",
  "Hey, you're back?": "TK-V105-0026",
  "Hey Seele, do you know where Aegis and Frigg are?": "TK-010-1195",
  "Hmm?": "TK-cobalt-1092",
  "Hmm? I feel we have met somewhere before...": "TK-cobalt-1022",
  "The only problem is... the fire control system is dead. We can't input direct fire coordinates.": "TK-002-5026",
  "Ah...": "TK-Mi_a-V005",
  "Ah... <purple>(thinking)</> Uncle Kolador is a good person, but he can be quite stern at times. I guess that's to be expected for someone in his position.": "TK-203-1013",
  "You can at least be conspicuous about it. Sure, Elric acquiesced to your research, but that spacetime fluctuation was too obvious to not see it.": "TK-002-3002",
  "What, you're with Hykros? My unlucky day.": "TK-313-3005",
  "Phew... Finally, it's over. It's all thanks to you. Not too shabby.": "TK-002-1105",
  "Oh, I almost forgot! This is Fennie. She's like my big sister, but she's only older than me by two days.": "TK-010-1029",
  "Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to offend. What happened to Shirli saddens me too, but...": "TK-002-1087",
  "Oh... Wait a minute. I think I've received a new message.": "UI-talk1344",
  "I'm detecting some very powerful interferences, these guys came prepared.": "TK-003-1116",
  "Hm? This is the Mega Arena. If you're not competing, then watch by the stands.": "TK-KING-1001",
  "Oh, maybe don't forget...": "TK-V114-0052",
  "Uh, I'm sorry, this is private property , it's not open to the public, tourists can come back later.": "TK-313-3006",
  "That's what I'd like to hear. Now, I'm going to start.": "TK-313-3032",
  "Wow, this is the <blue>special metal</> they used to build Omnium Tower back then.": "npc_book_403",
  "Ah, back so soon? Looks like things went well on your end...": "TK-417-4014",
  "Oh, here come the fun part.": "TK-313-3012",
  "Ah-ha-ha!": "TK-1103s-V013",
  "This sucks!": "npc_book5_541",
  "No! No hit Melo! No hit Melo!": "TK-301-1002",
  "Oh, right, have a seat. I'm sure you're hungry after traveling all the way, huh? Let's go try the new stuff over at Harriet's.": "TK-203-1124",
  "Daddy's coming!": "TK-0104-1003",
  "Ah! The door's finally open! Great! Thank you! Huh? You... Aren't you a Special Agent of Hykros? I saw you at the mine.": "TK-666-5001",
  "Oh, Executor from Aesperia, I wonder if you are interested and have the time to participate in our investigations and research right now?": "TK-V250-035",
  "Oh, you...": "TK-V250-001",
  "Good, you're finally awake.": "TK-cici-2012",
  "Good job! I'll take the data to Alfred.": "TK-003-1118",
  "Oh, actually... Dr. Joaquin commissioned me to pick up the copy of the weapon he ordered earlier.": "TK-player-1411_f",
  "Ah, not to worry! It won't harm you in any way. If you still have doubts, you're more than welcome to get a full physical check-up at the infirmary. Thank you for your cooperation.": "TK-101-1045",
  "Oh, wonderful, someone's here.": "npc_book_2_101",
  "Watch out, here they come again!": "TK-311-3081",
  "Oh, I know. I'll tell you in detail about your arrangement as an assistant after I'm done with this stage of work.": "TK-cobalt-1015",
  "Oh, Executor...": "TK-V109-p100",
  "I'm sorry, I can't help myself when I think about the past.": "v60400-TK-106-016",
  "Oh, I did have them. Or more accurately, someone entrusted them to me.": "TK-2006-1019",
  "Oh, it's {0}. Are you here to join in the festivities?": "TK-1103-1067",
  "Oh, we have another gutsy contender! Please see our manager <blue>Digsby</> and sign up!": "TK-0051-1005",
  "No need to introduce yourself. Everyone here knows you. So how does it feel to act like a hero?": "TK-002-1001",
  "Thank heavens someone's here!": "npc_book5_101",
  "Well... Can't get any worse than that, right...": "TK-002-1071",
  "Oh, it's <blue>Originum</>, which is what Hykros brought me to explore the ruin for.": "TK-002-1093",
  "Oh, uh...": "npc_book5_504",
  "Oh, hi, Mr. Kim!": "TK-410-4010",
  "What? Payment? Mr. Franz didn't...": "TK-player-1228_f",
  "You did...? No, I mean, I'm not Black Dog! I... I'm his brother, White Dog... Yeah, White Dog!": "TK-311-3021",
  "What? Think it over. There might be nothing left for you after these guys get satiated.": "TK-hum-016-1003",
  "Huh? You mean... you want to rush in there now!? I'm telling you, there's no way we can do it!": "TK-417-4008",
  "Wait, what do you want me to do?": "TK-player-1182_f",
  "Huh? Goodbye? What about my payment!? This thing isn't cheap!": "TK-125-1005",
  "Huh?... So, am I still me if I was broken down and reassembled?": "TK-player-1162_f",
  "Eh? I'm not ready yet...": "TK-food001-1011",
  "By himself? That crybaby? You sure that's a good idea...?": "TK-203-1028",
  "Now what?": "TK-player-1171_f",
  "Tsk...": "v60400-TK-112-001",
  "Tch... I remember the missing structure here is...": "TK-cobalt-1010",
  "Uninteresting.": "v60400-TK-112-017",
  "Hey, don't tell me you never tried to add more features to the suppressor?": "TK-010-1101",
  "Hey, have you told them everything?": "TK-002-1164",
  "Well, how is it? Give it to me straight, doc.": "TK-010-1145",
  "Hey! Surely you realized, between Claire and the Archon, well... Why do you think I'm not in there?": "TK-002-6019",
  "Hey, don't you think it's more dramatic this way?": "v60400-TK-111-007",
  "Hey, how about you take me to your big house, and I'll work for you as the keeper? Just room and board will do!": "TK-203-1089",
  "Isn't it basic etiquette to bring something for the person you're asking a favor from?": "v60400-TK-112-009",
  "Hey, who told you that, newcomer!? Nico's parents went to work for Banges, so don't you traumatize the kid!": "TK-025-1015",
  "Hey, are you Mr. Franz's smart servant?": "TK-player-1257_f",
  "Hey! It looks like he's made fools of both of us. From the looks of it, you can't afford this, can you?": "TK-125-1006",

  "If you want to see Sean, you got to go through Bai Ling first. The guards will let you in only with her permission.": "TK-226-5010",
  "You're here on assignment, right? Why don't I take you to the mine? We're in Hyena territory and this is not the place to be.": "TK-403-4005",
  "You're not calling me \"Big Fellow,\" are you?": "TK-player-3001",
  "You're not calling me big fellow, are you?": "TK-player-3001_f",
  "Hey, where were you? The celebration is almost over. You missed so many fun things!": "TK-203-1101",
  "Hey, congrats!": "TK-203-1082",
  "Where have you been? The celebration is about to start!": "TK-203-1086",
  "Hey, who's over there? Can you hear me?": "TK-313-5016",
  "Are you okay, Mr. Droid?": "TK-player-1254_f",
  "Hey, Crybaby. You better thank us for being so nice!": "TK-203-1035",
  "Hey, this is your first time here, right? How about a tour? I'm Hilda, by the way!": "TK-203-1106",
  "Hey, Lunis.": "TK-KING-1042",
  "Hey, conserve the food. Just <blue>three dishes</> will do.": "TK-205-1006",
  "Say a white lie.": "TK-025-1012",
  "See that guy over there? That's Hopkins, and if I'm correct, he's got Kolador's Astrum.": "TK-002-2018",
  "Yup. Powered by pure Omnium, with a carbon alloy body and magnetic brakes calibrated by yours truly—chief designer of Hykros. 280 horsepower, 300 torque, and its speed tops out at 230! What do you think?": "TK-125-1003",
  "Here—we found this, Heirs of Aida left this drone. I asked someone to repair it for you.": "TK-503-5012",
  "Oh, you must be the newcomer?": "TK-003-1055",
  "Oh, we meet again.": "TK-002-1017",
  "Oh? Didn't those Hykros people tell you? You should really ask them sometime.": "TK-313-3065",
  "Well, this is a secluded place. I'm impressed that Rubilia could find it.": "v21TK-V124-0006",
  "Paint": "semir-home-9",
  "(sighs) Never mind. Why don't we put our search on hold for a bit, and go visit Grandma Lucy? I haven't been back to see her in a long time.": "TK-1103-1029",
  "Like I said, nobody by the name of Samir has ever checked in here, not even once! You sure you got the name right?": "TK-282-2002",
  "Hey... It's no trouble at all. You'll always be a distinguished guest in this shelter. We're glad to help you in any way we can.": "TK-501-5017",
  "Hey, quit asking so many questions. Let's go!": "TK-667-5002",
  "Because I told you their evil plans, of course! They wanted to shut me up permanently!": "TK-311-3041",
  "Come on, I told you everything I know, no lies! Let me go. I won't misbehave ever again!": "TK-311-3031",
  "Great. Thanks for saving my life. I'll be sure to pay you back when I can.": "TK-311-3080",
  "Hey, that's exactly why I was looking for you!": "TK-311-3065",

  "Hello!": "TK-1103s-V001",
  "Hello there, Executor. You're finally here.": "v60400-TK-111-001",
  "Hmm... What did Foreman Giggs ask our group to come here for...? Oh yeah, prevention and treatment of miner's disease... But we were locked up as soon as we arrived here.": "TK-666-5002",
  "Don't remind me. I ran into the Hyenas and would've died if not for this hero here.": "TK-403-4006",
  "That's it?": "TK-203-1040",
  "Good to see you again!": "TK-karasuma-2007",
  "Giggs has been here for a while, but they're having quite a quarrel. You should check it out.": "TK-407-4006",
  "Well, people gotta be kind to each other, right?": "TK-203-1111",
  "Hey, long time no see, Hilda.": "TK-216-1001",
  "Mm.": "v60400-TK-player-071",
  "Umm..._f": "v60400-TK-player-071_f",
  "Yes... I got it, {0}.": "TK-V114-0018",
  "Hmm... I'll certainly bear your suggestions in mind. Thank you.": "TK-V107-0112",
  "Hmm... This is getting complicated.": "TK-002-2008",
  "How about you, did you have fun?": "TK-player-2129_f",
  "Oh... And... who are you?": "TK-313-3004",
  "Hmm... You found something, didn't you?": "TK-002-1142",
  "You don't look like you're worth much, so why don't you work off this debt? Since I'm left  here with a huge mess.": "TK-313-3050",
  "Yeah. See the <blue>seal</> on it? That means it is Omnium-powered and was manufactured by the government before the Cataclysm.": "npc_book_303",
  "Well... I just saw them from a distance, so I'm not sure. Did you, Melo?": "TK-302-3030",
  "Well... Mmhmm...": "v60400-TK-109-021",
  "Everyone has been practicing hard, and you've been helping us along the way.": "v60400-TK-106-046",
  "Hmm, where can it be...?": "npc_book_000",
  "Uh... okay, but the KaBOOM only lasts for a short time, so use it wisely!": "TK-304-3003",
  "Hmm... It should be. Maybe it's an older version. I've never seen it before.": "npc_book4_204",
  "Looks like our efforts are not enough.": "v60400-TK-106-029",
  "I would love to, but I don't know if I'm good enough.": "v60400-TK-106-002",
  "Well... maybe that's one way to adjust your mentality.": "TK-010-1180",
  "Well, Banges began as just a small remote settlement and life was tough. One year, there was a famine caused by pests, and attacks from enemies that almost wiped everything out.": "TK-203-1015",
  "So, how did the time retracement feel?": "TK-313-3062",
  "Astra Shelter... Area code HT501? Franz notified us about your visit. Come with me.": "TK-109-1004",
  "Luhn's belongings... I see...": "q204005_01_03",
  "Um... I have a favor to ask.": "UI-v60400-107-002",
  "Ah, I got an idea!": "TK-302-3070",
  "Well... Sure enough, it's a \"probe.\" Just as we expected.": "TK-109-1014",
  "So you're the only one Hykros sent?": "TK-402-4014",
  "Hykros is looking to shut off the tower with Astrum? I'll be very glad to help, but unfortunately, someone stole my Astrum sometime ago.": "TK-401-4008",
  "So... Giggs and Mr. Kim have different ideas, it seems. We should get leverage on Giggs. That will make us more proactive.": "TK-002-4015",
  "Hmmm... Looks like we're the ones tasked with this special op. Captain Lin, what dangerous mission will we be going on this time?": "v21TK-V124-0003",
  "Well... Victor is missing, while Meryl continues to work in Hykros. I also searched the Executor Order's archives for relevant records, but the results were basically the same.": "TK-101-1074",
  "Hmm... How about a VIP meal at Oasis?": "TK-V107-0018",
  "Well, it's shipped to South Beach... Thinking back, I had weird feelings when I went to pick it up.": "TK-402-4026",
  "I mean, she's not a very serious person, and it's entirely possible that she was just meddling, but I'm thinking maybe she... did it for me.": "v60400-TK-109-024",
  "Want a bite?": "TK-player-1181_f",
  "Yeah. Follow me, I know a secret passage in.": "TK-203-1063",
  "Right... That's a good answer... Thanks.": "v21TK-V124-0018",
  "Hmm... So he has chosen to give up on straightening things out with me and defected to the Heirs of Aida? What a pity.": "TK-401-4045",
  "Yep... They're Mirroria's biggest problem at the moment. I don't know much about them, though, so maybe you're better off asking Director Eva.": "TK-peppa-V005",
  "Okay, let's do this.": "TK-player-3014_f",
  "Well... this matter is... somewhat troublesome. I thought the Heirs of Aida just wanted to get their hands on a prototype of the time engine from me. But it seems...": "TK-313-5004",
  "No one in Hyenas is really likable, but I think Prynce is a nice guy.": "npc_book5_513",
  "Yeah, unfortunately, they've passed away...": "TK-025-1013",
  "It's been a while since I had fish. It's delicious when you steam it and put some sauce on it...": "TK-039-1007",
  "Yes... me too...": "TK-V114-0054",
  "Yeah.": "v60400-TK-114-009",
  "Hmm.": "TK-player-1536_f",
  "Hmm. I'm... happy to see everything's back on track.": "TK-010-1211",
  "That would be great. I'll get started if there's nothing else to confirm.": "v60400-TK-812-011",
  "Okay, I'm going to start working now. Don't disturb me unless there's something else you want from me.": "TK-cobalt-1091",
  "Yes! Dolly and I want to give Mi-a some gifts! Keep this secret between us!": "TK-V113-p117",
  "Hmm? What?": "UI-v60400-113-006",
  "Mmhm. You said it, Mi-a! Uncle Palu, you'd be smart to listen!": "TK-010-1154",
  "Umm.": "TK-cobalt-1100",
  "Uh-huh!": "Tk-010-1238",
  "Yes. Fields only appears where there is an Abyssant. We'd never seen an ability like this before, and if it hadn't been for Samir and Huma giving us such valuable insights, I fear we might have found it more difficult.": "TK-V107-0064",
  "Yes, of course!": "TK-option-145",
  "Sure! That's settled.": "TK-010-V022",
  "Oh? What is it?": "TK-203-1071",
  "Yes, his name is Victor.": "TK-V114-P125",
  "I have faith in you! Now, I can repair this old hunk of junk.": "TK-010-1170",
  "Yeah. Be careful.": "v21TK-v124-0028",
  "Well, what do you want to ask about?": "TK-V114-P105",
  "Yes, goodbye...": "TK-vplayer-p237_f",
  "Yeah, I made the decision.": "npc_book5_837",
  "Right. Ms. Lin said Ruby waking up might have something to do with us rescuing Dr. Rubilia. We better check on her since you don't have anything to do at the moment.": "v21TK-010-V020",
  "Yes. Let's go.": "TK-option-255",
  "Didn't Hanna tell you? You're not the only one here looking for me. But it doesn't seem like you get along well with the other tourists.": "TK-313-3008",
  "Yes, I'd like to have a rehearsal before we start practice today.": "v60400-TK-player-040",
  "Yes, I'd like to have a rehearsal before we start practice today._f": "v60400-TK-player-040_f",
  "Yes, she contacted me. I think it's important to make Ruby's wish come true, so here I am.": "v60400-TK-114-006",
  "If you think I'll be fine, then I'll do it.": "v60400-TK-114-008",
  "Yes. My uncle spent a lot of money developing it, only for those to rob us blind!": "TK-402-4003",
  "Yeah, I can also feel the atmosphere becoming tense around here. Should we keep moving or wait until the communication is restored?": "v21TK-V124-0021",
  "Okay. Let's go see the scrapper now.": "TK-player-1332_f",
  "Yes. We have a lot to do. Help the people here resolve the crisis, and then... Find my brother.": "TK-010-V018",
  "Alright, let's go.": "TK-1103-V016",
  "Alright. Let's go, and come home together. All four of us.": "TK-player-1281_f",
  "Yes. I just heard from Meryl. The station is safe and sound.": "TK-1103-V015",
  "Yes, I'm back.": "TK-cobalt-1067",
  "Yes, I'm listening.": "v60400-TK-114-010",
  "I know what you mean.": "v60400-TK-106-017",
  "Yes. I promised Hykros that I would help them resolve this crisis. Oh, and Franz said he left me a gift. I wonder what it could be.": "TK-player-1287_f",
  "Yeah, I should go back. Oh, about your friend Zeke...": "TK-216-1016",
  "Yep, we tangoed a couple times. Wasn't too hard.": "TK-1103s-V009",
  "Please help me.": "TK-101-1088",
  "No problem. I guess we'll be heading back to Headquarters then.": "TK-V107-0090",
  "Yes, he's a man in a prominent position among the Heirs of Aida.": "TK-002-2117",
  "Yes, Spark sent me this today. Maybe it thinks Ruby's dream should be looked into.": "v60400-TK-107-003",
  "Hmm, yes.": "TK-010-1226",
  "Yes, it is! You're a godsend! I can't stand another minute with these fools!": "TK-402-4008",
  "Yeah, no problem.": "TK-cobalt-1061",
  "Yeah, you look much better now, newcomer. I'd like to ask you a favor, though.": "TK-001-1010",
  "Yeah, Happy Graceday!": "TK-player-2198_f",
  "Okay, just a moment.": "v60400-TK-107-060",
  "Right, thank you. My companion here is coming with us.": "TK-player-1346_f",
  "Thank you. My friend Franz will go with me too.": "TK-player-5011_f",
  "Well, the Angels of Clemency process a special kind of radiofrequency transceiver function.": "TK-010-1183",
  "Sure, lead the way.": "q204006-2",
  "I think that's everyone.": "v60400-TK-107-026",
  "Well, that completes the Development Center.": "TK-207-1096",
  "Right. That makes sense. The message Rubilia left in the Abyss also clearly states that she's been affected by the voices in her head. That voice may come from a higher-class Abyssant.": "v21TK-V122-0035",
  "So you came to see me just to find out about this?": "TK-cobalt-1029",
  "Take care of yourself!": "TK-203-1056",
  "The eye stared at us... I'm so scared... So I ran away with Spark.": "v21TK-V113-0002",
  "In that case, me and Dolly will guard Mi-a here until Shelly starts working on her!": "TK-V113-p114",
  "Well, let's go see Ms. Lin for a bit. Even if we can't comfort her, at least we can let her know that we're all there for her.": "v21TK-010-V011",
  "Hmm, that would give me time to search for your item... Very well, friend; you have my thanks.": "q204007_00_12",
  "<blue>Astrum</>? Sorry, that's contraband around here. You gotta go somewhere else for that.": "TK-2006-1002",
  "Hmm?_f": "v60400-TK-player-075_f",
  "Er? I can't think of any wishes I have.\n\nI know, I'll wish for everyone else's wishes to come true!": "TK-card-002",
  "You sound like you were expecting me.": "v60400-TK-player-028",
  "You sound like you were expecting me._f": "v60400-TK-player-028_f",
  "Huh? What are you doing back here? We were worried that we might be short of hands!": "TK-003-5001",
  "Huh? What brings you here?": "TK-313-1001",
  "You must not be from here. You should leave, there's an outbreak of miner's disease here!": "TK-404-4001",
  "Hmm? Who might you be?": "TK-125-1001",
  "Do you have any ideas?": "TK-player-2050_f",
  "Huh? Did you just say you gathered all of this yourselves? You'd need weeks to get this much. How did you do it so quickly?": "TK-V105-0028",
  "Huh? Now that you mentioned that...": "TK-1103-1072",
  "Hey, what happened?": "TK-player-2139_f",
  "Sounds like a handsome young man... Could this Zeke be... you know?": "TK-218-1004",
  "Huh? Oh yeah, that reminds me. You're the new assistant, aren't you?": "TK-cobalt-1011",
  "Huh? Bad guys? The people on Raincaller Island?": "TK-313-3002",
  "Huh? What for...?": "TK-player-2125_f",
  "Hm? Sorry, I was kind of out of it.": "v60400-TK-106-031",
  "Oh? Seems we might be in luck. Shelly is Mirroria's technical consultant. If you agree, maybe she could check over Mi-a, and repair anything she can?": "TK-V107-0014",
  "Looks like the initialization is complete. Your suppressor <blue>can be upgraded</> now!": "TK-010-1099",
  "Oh? A District 9 smart servant? Where?": "TK-V105-0007",
  "Well? What is it?": "v60400-TK-111-017",
  "Has Shirli met with trouble?": "TK-121-1039",
  "Tell me what?": "npc_book5_512",
  "Anything else?": "TK-C003-1001",
  "Is this the same drug passed out to the miners recently?": "TK-player-4071_f",
  "You must be new here... Can you help me out? Come closer, don't let Curio over there hear this.": "TK-145-1001",
  "Shhh... Someone hid Mr. Lynx's <blue>sugar paper</>, and he's about to go off!": "TK-0294-1003",
  "Be quieter, guest. There's a lot of bad guys ahead, and they've got a big-- KaBOOM! They'll won't be easy to deal with!": "TK-302-3081",

  "See, you got the thing now, so why don't we pretend we never saw each other?": "TK-311-3056",
  "Humph... Stop giggling like a fool. So, what brings you here today?": "TK-218-1003",
  "I like people like you.": "npc_book5_836",
  "That's very nice of you. Do you have any other nice things to say about me?": "v60400-TK-111-012",
  "So, I had that same dream again.": "UI-v60400-113-002",
  "Hey, didn't you see me chatting to my buddy here?": "TK-048-1001",
  "Hey, dude, did you bet? You're looking at a windfall if you hit!": "TK-0061-1001",
  "Hey, it's you again. Wanna hear a joke?": "TK-karasuma-2010",
  "Yeah, that's right, you.": "TK-410-4001",
  "Uh... You are...": "TK-203-1120",

  "Ah, you're from Aesperia. It hasn't been long since you've come to Vera, right?": "TK-V250-002",
  "Ah, so you're looking for Flora, eh? Darn memory of mine, I almost forgot! She came by to visit a few days ago, and even left a letter for Peach! Here, take a look!": "TK-1104-1006",
  "Oh, my new toy is here?": "TK-215-1007",
  "Oh, I volunteered for this team. After all, isn't the investigation of potential Grayspace Entities invasions also for the safety of the city?": "TK-V108-0001",
  "Oh, I forgot! I invited people from HT201 Shelter to come as well. They should be here soon.": "TK-203-1144",
  "Oh, so I'm supposed to hand it over just like that? What if I refuse?": "TK-1103s-1010",
  "Hey, this is an early-model <blue>weapon part</>!": "npc_book_408",
  "Oh? Then I believe this belongs to you! I've only been in business for about a year, but I haven't met anyone else around here named Flora.": "TK-282-2001",

  "Okay, thanks. I'll try someone else.": "TK-player-2165_f",
  "Fine, this guy's got some moves that I can trust.": "TK-KING-1025",
  "(sighs) Fine. You're free to leave.": "TK-player-3073_f",
  "Alright. I'll take care of that while you keep an eye out for Zeke.": "TK-203-1029",
  "Alright, Mr. Kim. Thank you for the information.": "TK-player-4105_f",
  "Sure, it's on my way.": "npc_book5_112",
  "It's too loud...": "npc_book6_405b",
  "Sure. Let's go.": "TK-player-V014",
  "Okay, let's go.": "TK-player-V014_f",
  "She threw down the gauntlet, and I shall rise to the challenge.": "v60400-TK-111-019",
  "Okay, where's the shortcut?": "TK-player-1244_f",
  "Sure. Get on board with her then.": "TK-V107-0008",
  "That's enough! Everyone's okay, and that's the main thing. But the next time there's an Abyssant with unknown abilities, don't take it so lightly.": "TK-V107-0066",
  "Alright, no time to waste. Come back quickly!": "npc_book4_217",
  "Anyway, now that's done, you can really show the newcomer around the shelter and see if anything needs help.": "TK-013-1048",
  "Coming right up!": "v60400-TK-183-002",
  "Luckily I have some friends who deal with things under the counter. They shared some valuable information.": "TK-002-1177",
  "Fortunately, the incident didn't lead to any serious consquences thanks to you, young one. You did very well.": "TK-101-1031",
  "Lots of old stuff... Hey, here's a notebook. This is probably the diary he was talking about.": "npc_book2_202",
  "Okay, I checked the internal structure of the Astra Omnium Tower, and it's a mess. It's going to take time to reorganize the energy circuit.": "TK-002-1030",
  "Okay, sorry, I slipped. I'll figure everything out, okay?": "TK-002-1023",
  "Alright, I understand. Hand it over and let's get out of here first.": "TK-313-5003",
  "Take a good look, my precious mechanical arm is completely ruined!": "TK-313-3047",
  "So strong!": "npcyixisiqifenzu_talk6",
  "I miss the old days so much.": "TK-0022-1002",
  "I'd love to be someone plain without any aspiration...": "TK-0111-1001",
  "Yes...": "TK-vplayer-p211_f",
  "Ok.": "q501001_01_07",
  "Okay!": "TK-player-2017_f",
  "Got it. You take care!": "TK-player-4080_f",
  "Sounds good, Lin. Lead the way!": "TK-010-V042",
  "Fine. Bye.": "TK-player-2097_f",
  "Okay, I'm going to take a stroll around.": "TK-player-2217_f",
  "You can count on me.": "TK-player-1189_f",
  "Yes, father...": "TK-216-1011",
  "Okay, see you at the hangar.": "TK-player-2131_f",
  "Okay, where does Mr. Fenyr live?": "npc_book3_108",
  "Okay. I'm new, but I'll do my best.": "v60400-TK-109-016",
  "Okay. Thanks.": "TK-player-4021_f",
  "Okay, thank you...": "npc_book3_607",
  "Alright, thanks. I'll go take a look.": "TK-player-5034_f",
  "Sure, follow me. I'll convince them to leave.": "TK-403-4015",
  "In that case, I will leave you to it.": "v60400-TK-player-016",
  "In that case, I will leave you to it._f": "v60400-TK-player-016_f",
  "Suit yourself.": "TK-314-1016",
  "Of course. Here, two fried chicken meals for you, on the house.": "TK-218-1008",
  "Easy, easy! I got a flying vehicle you can ride.": "TK-417-4028",
  "Alright!": "TK-sm-1002",
  "Fine! I'll team up with you first, and then we'll battle it out after! Curse that Gordon! Curse him!": "TK-0066-1004",
  "Understood. Get ready, you two. We're heading into the test area.": "TK-V107-0087",
  "Cool!": "npc_book5_434",
  "Alright, Palu will pick you up. I have to investigate the situation in the south first. See you later.": "TK-002-5042",
  "You got a deal!": "TK-player-4049_f",
  "Alright, let's go to the bridge.": "TK-player-5050_f",
  "Okay, let's go teach them a lesson!": "TK-player-3022_f",
  "Okay, I'll help you chase down their airship and make them pay!": "TK-001-1035",
  "Okay, I will.": "TK-player-2222_f",
  "I promise I'll follow the rules. Now would you let me see them?": "TK-player-3042_f",
  "Okay, I'll meet back up with you once I get a lead.": "TK-player-4056_f",
  "Okay. Now.": "TK-001-3007",
  "Okay, come with me. I'll take you to Banges Port.": "TK-player-1502_f",
  "Yes, yes...": "TK-013-1005",
  "Okay. You be safe!": "TK-cici-5002",
  "They've become more irritable, sensitive. When they see a creature they find suspicious, they will attack it immediately.": "TK-V250-043",
  "Now, reemergence is close at hand, but the fools want to destroy it again.": "TK-101-1019",
  "How shall we deal with the Grayspace Entities and the energy crisis?": "TK-V114-P109",
  "How are you coping? Are you familiar with the place yet?": "TK-207-1110",
  "As you may know, most people don't see things our way. We must protect the Tower of Fantasy from potential danger. That's why we formed the Special Forces.": "TK-104-1004",
  "If it wasn't for the disaster, I would've been a successful entrepreneur.": "TK-007-1002",
  "If the unstable energy is not negated, the Tower of Fantasy risks going out of control once the Omnium threshold is exceeded.": "TK-101-1012",
  "If we can't turn it off as soon as possible... We're likely to see a large-scale energy leak.": "TK-002-5005",
  "If I couldn't save Black Dog, I'd be trapped forever, right?": "TK-player-3095_f",
  "If you came here unprepared, you should stay in school for a few more years.": "npc_book_3_316",
  "If they already have the ability to start the engine, what can we possibly do?": "TK-001-5028",
  "If they are willing to help, we may be able to turn this around.": "TK-313-5014",
  "If they acknowledge me, I can better prove I can live on my own. What do you think?": "npc_book5_833",
  "If they send a large offensive force, I doubt Hykros could hold them off, given the current state of their defenses.": "TK-002-5060",
  "If he really did come to the Vera region, he's most likely doing his best to stay under the radar.": "TK-V103-0003",
  "If he falls into the hands of the Heirs of Aida, we won't be able to interpret the intelligence. We have to get him back.": "TK-003-5016",
  "If you must have a definite opponent for yourself...": "TK-cobalt-1056",
  "Mind helping me if you're interested?": "npc_book_106",
  "I'll be grateful to you if you can get along well with her.": "TK-V107-p103",
  "If you're bored, it can drop inducers to lure enemies on the island to you for your amusement.": "TK-207-1052",
  "If you're going to keep going, you must accept my terms.": "TK-101-1006",
  "If you give me <blue>sugar paper</>, I'll tell you a secret.": "TK-0294-1002",
  "If you have some more time to spare, please continue to collect mana bio samples to help us accelerate our research on it.": "TK-101-1117",
  "Sure, we'll take any help we can get. When the Heirs of Aida retreated, I ordered someone to tail them. She should send word any time now.": "TK-501-5006",
  "I'll tell you if you can catch two fireflies for me.": "TK-0053-1002",
  "Together, I believe we'll craft the most advanced thruster in the world, and when we do...": "TK-125-1018",
  "Don't tell me that the machines \"didn't do anything wrong,\" so we shouldn't destroy them... That would be such a pain.": "TK-KING-1033",
  "If you are intent on entering the <blue>Chrono Chamber</>, please be careful. I have detected prominent signs of aberration within.": "TK-huasheng-1013",
  "But if it's not out of your way, maybe you could deliver some things Ironpalm needs?": "TK-cobalt-1110",
  "If Lin also comes...": "TK-V113-p104",
  "If Garcia would give me the power core, I guarantee you'd be amazed!": "TK-125-1022",
  "If you could find the nexus on the current timeline, you can change events to create a new timeline.": "TK-104-4005",
  "Please notify me immediately if you spot the Ravagers.": "TK-037-1001",
  "If possible...": "TK-V114-0043",
  "If you ever lose yourself again, I will help you find your way back. That I swear.": "TK-player-1547_f",
  "If there are no further questions, we'll meet up at the entrance to the Confounding Abyss.": "v21TK-V103-0042",
  "It will fetch an even better price if it's working. So if you can fix it, I'll pretend you never scrubbed the disk clean. Deal?": "npc_book_3_334",
  "Please ask her to hurry if she hasn't completed as much as she should.": "TK-101-1084",
  "If they decide to pursue Samir, her best course of action will be to surrender herself and T-04's data, and accept her punishment.": "TK-101-1071",
  "Only IF the doctor says you're fine. And this is...?": "TK-207-1003",
  "For further information, please log into the Ops and Maintenance database. You will need relevant security clearance to access these files.": "TK-121-1017",
  "If we could return from a particular point in time or even make changes, then, in theory, we would be free from the constraints of time itself.": "TK-104-4016",
  "If our actions somehow broke the balance between the Confounding Abyss and our reality, the whole city would pay for our failure.": "v21TK-V107-0062",
  "I'd fight for sure if I were a couple years younger.": "TK-0069-1002",
  "(whispered) Listen, if I were you, I wouldn't trust everything they say.": "TK-002-1108",
  "If I don't get Shirli's personality back... Or lose myself again... Am I going to become what they are?": "Tk-010-1236",
  "If I'm right, they've already built a similar device, many times larger than my little gadget—a super time machine.": "TK-313-5005",
  "The defensive force field can't continue to function if it runs out.": "TK-V114-P114",
  "If he wants me to be happy, just let me quit the stupid gang!": "npc_book5_552",
  "And if it wasn't for what happened later... Maybe that childish dream of ours could have come true...": "TK-1103-1025",
  "It'll all be for nothing if we can't find any clues to open this lockbox.": "v21TK-V124-0013",
  "Without enough energy to connect her artificial synapses, I'm afraid the poor kid would never regain her senses.": "TK-313-3022",
  "If there are enough supplies, I can make biscuits for everyone.": "TK-046-1009",
  "If it really is what we think it is, then things might get a bit tricky...": "TK-002-2121",
  "If you really do find something, be careful not to alert those people. These trouble makers are constantly rolling.": "TK-002-2113",
  "If we can locate and defeat the Abyssant, obtaining its Crystamax would certainly help accelerate our research in Grayspace Entities.": "TK-V103-0016",
  "Who knows? If you manage to find the data on Prototype T-04 here, you can go back even sooner.": "TK-1103-1056",
  "If the Heirs of Aida found Astrum already, we'll have to go to Plan B.": "TK-002-2012",
  "If Rubilia really did create a superior Abyssant with human intelligence and in human form but outside of human control, it would be a great disaster for all of mankind.": "v21TK-V103-0015",
  "If the authentication system is still workable, there won't be any trouble, but I think there's an 80... or 90 percent chance that's not going to happen.": "TK-cobalt-1050",
  "We might be able to increase the engine efficiency by 20% if we tune the transmission a bit. Or... never mind.": "TK-cobalt-1005",
  "Unless there's a new kid named Brian in the neighborhood, that would be me.": "TK-226-5001",
  "If Diana doesn't fear this unknown, what should you be afraid of then?": "npc_book3_743",
  "You're welcome to come and ask me if you have any questions.": "TK-V104-p102",
  "You know what we have to do if they mutated.": "TK-player-1340_f",
  "If it really came for Ruby, then Lin must've hidden something from us, both about the monster and Ruby.": "v21TK-V108-0004",
  "If he asks for money, tell him to collect from me. After all, I should also be held accountable for this.": "TK-401-4042",
  "If he really was on Astra... Everything that's happened so far would be the least of our troubles.": "TK-002-1157",
  "Such a large amount of live metal... it feels like something's going on. I hope I'm just overthinking it...": "TK-002-2114",
  "Its shape is peculiar even for Grayspace Entities. Maybe its structure hides something unique that we don't know about...": "TK-V250-056",
  "Making such a long-distance jump is no easy task. You should prepare yourselves.": "TK-313-V004",
  "Mommy isn't in the shelter right now, and I don't want to bother Uncle Palu when he's so busy... But I really want to have some of my mommy's <blue>fruit cake</> today!": "TK-025-1004",
  "We can give it a try.": "TK-option-117",
  "At least no core was harmed. Given your ability, you'll be able to repair them if you want.": "TK-KING-1036",
  "Your name... What's your name!?": "TK-1103s-1013",
  "He hires me to do jobs.": "npc_book_3_002b",

  "It's a holiday special: summer seafood noodles. Eat them before they get cold.": "TK-203-1160",
  "Kids will eventually grow up and make up their own minds.": "npc_book5_618",
  "Wait, child, I've got something to say to you...": "TK-207-1020",
  "This has been encrypted in such a way that it can only be opened in Hykros.": "q204009_00_06",
  "They leave their body fluids or footprints, and may even collect and arrange stones on the ground as markers to divide their territory. If their enemy invades their territory, they will rush over to fight mercilessly.": "TK-V250-030",
  "It monitors and collects all sorts of environmental data on the island in real-time, and it alerts when there's an anomaly.": "TK-207-1051",
  "It can be installed in all types of weapons and analyze combat data on the fly to help you find the opponent's weaknesses.": "TK-207-1042",
  "It probably has a camera, but its Omnium battery is damaged.": "npc_book_305",
  "It's out of power. We have to do this ourselves. The relic Peanut mentioned should be in the box over there.": "TK-cici-1011",
  "It's highly dangerous, Claire. We're both survivors, and you know full well the consequences when it loses control.": "TK-002-3003",
  "How does it work?": "TK-option-243",
  "It is, but don't let it out next time.": "TK-145-1010",
  "Hold the bridge until the <blue>defense turret</> can be activated!": "TK-001-1031",

  "Where's security? Is anyone else being held captive?": "TK-player-2039_f",
  "The guards have been activated.": "q204009_00_01",
  "Leave that to me. You just open the door.": "TK-player-2051_f",
  "Security clearance? How do I get it?": "TK-player-1251_f",
  "Safety overload! Watch out, here they come!": "TK-2541-5004",
  "I placed some guards at the door to be on the safe side. Go and confirm whether he is who he says he is.": "TK-501-5011",
  "To be on the safe side, I'd recommend remaining here until the fluctuations have resolved before heading out.": "TK-V101-0004",
  "Anna... I couldn't save her, but I promised her our son will grow up happy and healthy!": "TK-207-1014",

  "Directional parameters were corrected, but the results still need verification.": "TK-313-V001",
  "I'm sorry, but I just received a message from Headquarters. Something's come up which needs me to help remotely, so I'm afraid I won't be able to go with you.": "TK-V107-0037",
  "Frankly, the Omnium Tower's activation could end in <blue>a disaster</>, just like fifty years ago.": "TK-101-1009",
  "Experiments go wrong all the time, which is perfectly understandable. What I can't forgive, however, is that someone would take advantage of Luhn's pure love for science, knowing that there are so many unpredictable risks involved with the experiment...": "q204006_02_06",
  "There are no security systems installed in the lab, but it holds a great number of Grayspace Entity samples. The samples should either be in stasis or deceased, but we really don't have enough information. Stay vigilant.": "v21TK-V107-0025",
  "Only you know the location of the lab, Lin. I will need you to take a team and retrieve the research data.": "v21TK-V103-0024",
  "I have relayed the coordinates to the lab to you. Make sure you've received it. If there are no further questions, let's head out.": "v21TK-V107-0026",

  "How do you plan to get in?": "TK-302-3101",
  "Are you okay, Honored Guest?": "TK-302-3066",
  "You are absolutely right, Wanderer. But I'm afraid the doctor will only get upset if she sees me like this...": "TK-302-3008",
  "With the KaBOOM, our customers can defeat all manner of evildoers!": "TK-302-3051",
  "You're right, Honored Guest! We're still far from the heart of the island. Let's hurry!": "TK-302-3060",

  "Oh, who's your uncle?": "TK-player-1118_f",
  "By the way, your Heavy System is not a product of Aida's technology. Ms. Cobalt-B is studying it carefully. The repair may take some time.": "TK-player-1504_f",

  "Yes, they have arrived safely at Banges Port and are resting in Cobalt-B's studio.": "TK-player-1512_f",
  "Yes, because of the gorgers. That's why I have to go back to my planet as soon as possible. There are people I want to protect at Lighthouse.": "TK-marc-10",
  "Yes, there are many defensive traps that are kind of dangerous inside... Although they were placed there many years ago, I'm afraid most of them are still functioning.": "TK-cobalt-1049",

  "But things are never quite so easily settled... And I don't believe understanding the past will change anything about her current situation.": "q204013_00_08",
  "Of course, it's not all for that purpose, I also want to... expand my knowledge during the journey, and find the true meaning of being born here as an Angel of Clemency.": "TK-010-1217",
  "Of course. I'll wipe out the gorgers on Aida before I go back.": "TK-marc-11",
  "Of course, our labs are conducting targeted experiments. However, this is the first occurrence of such illness. We have to start from scratch.": "TK-401-4021",
  "Of course. I shall reward you accordingly.": "npc_book_2_111b",
  "Naturally, it's going to take at least two hours given how big and complicated this machine is.": "TK-cobalt-1090",
  "Of course, you'll be paid handsomely for your work. The ball's in your court. Just let me know.": "TK-0024-1022",
  "She caught me, of course.": "npc_book_2_305",
  "Of course, all these are just speculations. We don't know the actual truth for the time being.": "TK-101-1078",
  "Correct. This is the most important discovery of Project Listener to date. Dr. Clive sent me a message this morning to say he was so excited that he couldn't even sleep last night. I just hope he doesn't mess up at the press conference.": "TK-V107-0094",
  "The situation is still harsh...": "TK-104-1001",
  "I've seen all kinds of people and backgrounds. I even know their situation better than they do.": "TK-401-4004",
  "Like fireworks, lanterns are part of the festivity! That's the way every year. Everyone's looking forward to it!": "TK-203-1098",

  "Lanterns?": "TK-010-1245",
  "Lantern?": "TK-cici-2011",
  "The two kids are Zeke and Shirli. Their parents were members of the Heirs of Aida.": "TK-002-1159",
  "Standby...": "TK-121-1030",
  "It's amazing...": "TK-V114-0030",
  "Shocked? The project hasn't gone public yet. You'll be one of the first official residents.": "TK-207-1029",
  "But it's a shame much of the original records were lost in the Cataclysm.": "npc_book6_310",
  "Surprised? As you said, I have been here for many years, and naturally, I have my way of getting information, but I can't say anything more than that. Walls have ears, you know.": "TK-401-4053",
  "Very well, Dr. Henry will compile the data for evaluation. Only if you pass can you be granted access to gene lock.": "TK-104-1057",
  "Very well, Inquisitor Klema is waiting. Go see him.": "TK-104-1011",
  "Good. I'll have someone disarm the ones in the lobby. You two can take care of the one on the dome.": "TK-104-1089",
  "Very good, young one! You're a visionary, and I think you've got potential. The future needs people like us.": "TK-125-1016",

  "Very good, I will look forward to your performance.": "TK-104-1116",

  "Sorry for the trouble. I will find a way to solve it.": "TK-marc-05",
  "I'm sorry, Archon Larsen. Rubilia never said anything about a lockbox to me. It was Sirius who found the hidden compartment inside by accident.": "v21TK-V107-0042",
  "I'm sorry. I am unable to give you the answers right now. And it is not because I do not trust you—you have more than proven yourself in the bomb crisis.": "TK-104-1092",
  "I've been planning an artificial island for a long time. It's also a dream of Theo's. It's time I make it real.": "TK-207-1072",
  "Obviously, the fight option is not among my available tasks, so protecting myself when I encounter danger and protecting the doctor's data is my prime directive.": "TK-574-1007",
  "It's straightforward! You stand here, smash all the cans with a ball, and you win!": "TK-203-1054",
  "Really, really far away? How far is that? Is it farther than the research station from here?": "TK-V113-p101",
  "It's hard...": "npc_book3_706",
  "I can't say for sure, but I know that they're willing to do anything it takes to achieve their goal.": "TK-002-1147",
  "A pleasure doing business with you. Come again!": "TK-2006-1026",

  "You?": "TK-207-1006",
  "Wow, it's really late. Time passes so fast!": "TK-203-1019",
  "What's the matter, Meryl?": "TK-vplayer-p210_f",
  "What's wrong?": "TK-vplayer-p230_f",
  "What is it? Why are you upset?": "TK-player-2023_f",
  "No, it can't be, can't be...": "TK-203-1077",
  "How did that happen? Shirli was still fine yesterday...": "TK-013-1020",
  "What now? Should we still try to find Theo?": "TK-player-2038_f",
  "You again? Don't you ever want to go home?": "TK-player-3069_f",
  "What is it now?": "npc_book_3_338",
  "Huh? It's far from it. I'll come for another spar when you're in better shape.": "TK-903-1009",
  "What the heck...": "npc_book4_629",
  "So, it's beautiful on the Artificial Island, isn't it?": "TK-203-1087",

  "What's up? Oh, good job on retrieving the intelligence.": "TK-003-5012",
  "That was fun, wasn't it?": "TK-010-1162",
  "Not too shabby, am I right?": "TK-010-1006",
  "So, did you find President Kolador and Theo?": "TK-204-1011",

  "Did Mi-a find anything she's interested in?": "v60400-TK-107-024",
  "So? When are the Hyenas leaving?": "TK-218-1030",
  "What to think of it? What to do? You're free to make your own decisions.": "TK-314-1014",
  "What, another new demand?": "TK-0023-1001",
  "Would you like to chat with me?": "TK-013-1019",
  "What's the matter, is it too hard for you?": "TK-TFB02-005",
  "Why? You want your old job back?": "TK-218-1001",
  "What now? Heirs of Aida send a fool for interrogation?": "TK-204-1002",
  "No wonder it stinks here... They're making aberrants!": "TK-302-3097",
  "I can't believe I was dumb enough to fall for the Heirs of Aida's lies, thinking they could save my son...": "TK-207-1068",
  "The Monster": "bookquest20",
  "Either way... Farewell...": "TK-V114-0053",

  "Well, I'm at a dead end. What about you?": "TK-player-2083_f",
  "Just make sure you don't disappoint the Archon. You have a bright future ahead of you.": "TK-002-1109",
  "Anyway, it's all thanks to your help today!": "TK-003-1065",
  "Anyway, we must be careful not to waste too much time here!": "TK-302-3065",
  "Anyway, when Charles touched that thing, the device was accidentally activated and we were surrounded by some bizarre energy, and then... we got here.": "TK-marc-23",
  "I'll give any rulebreakers something to remember. You got that?": "TK-KING-1006",
  "Anyway, I smell crisis... You better watch your back.": "TK-V111-p101",
  "Anyway, my guess is that Ruby watched the show, and now she wants to go see a concert.": "v60400-TK-107-007",
  "But anyway, it's your call. Please be careful!": "TK-302-3104",
  "As you can see, this is a very risky operation. We better wait for Archon Larsen to make the final decision.": "v21TK-V107-0063",
  "Basically, this is the latest and most powerful model. Don't overestimate your driving skills with this thing until you get familiar with it.": "TK-125-1004",
  "Overall, I must say that you've done well.": "TK-V114-0029",
  "That way of thinking fills your life with doubts, and I don't like that.": "npc_book6_125",
  "People called me unfeeling, but I'm used to seeing death. So, what are you doing here, little guy?": "TK-002-1088",
  "Overall, things are going smoothly. I did lose my supply backpack while scaling the cliff. All I have now is half an energy bar in my pocket. I wonder how long it can last me.": "v21TK-V128-0002",
  "I've got a feeling that it's almost done... If I just fine-tune it a bit here...": "TK-cobalt-1013",
  "Where is the order from HQ?": "TK-C005-1002",
  "Forgive me for being frank, Ms. Lin. This thing has profound influences. If we can't work together and solve this crisis together, I'm afraid...": "v21TK-V115-0001",
  "The recovery is going quite well, and rejection of the living metal has weakened to a controllable level.": "TK-313-1002",
  "My savior, the Heirs of Aida base camp is just on the mountain ahead.": "TK-311-3070",
  "My savior! One second more and those savages would've fed me to the fishes!": "TK-311-3040",
  "My savior, I've finally found you!": "TK-311-3061",
  "My savior, I haven't been here before... I don't know where Iron Fist might be locked up, and there are so many guards. What should we do?": "TK-311-3072",
  "Congratulations! You've won the semi-finals! The next round is a bit more... interesting. A test of your humanity, if you will.": "TK-0024-1012",
  "Abyssants caused this inhospitable desert?": "TK-010-V012",
  "H-Hello... Mr. Klema.": "TK-player-1058_f",
  "Have you put yourself in the miners' shoes?": "TK-player-4034_f",
  "You can get to the station on the upper level from the tunnel underneath the base. Good luck.": "TK-401-4017",
  "You can explain it.": "TK-option-197",
  "You have run things here for many years. However, Giggs was able to conspire with the Heirs of Aida and secretly smuggle drugs right under your nose... You really didn't notice anything off?": "TK-player-4100",
  "You have run here for many years. However, Giggs was able to conspire with the Heirs of Aida and secretly smuggle drugs right under your nose... You really didn't notice anything off?": "TK-player-4100_f",

  "How can you tell?": "TK-player-4064_f",
  "Are you asking me to join Hykros?": "TK-player-1060_f",
  "You mean time retracement?": "TK-player-4003_f",
  "Are you here to sign up for the <blue>Mega Arena</>? You've come at the wrong time. There's no match right now.": "TK-0051-1001",
  "You mean another Cataclysm?": "TK-player-1050_f",
  "You mean... just wait?": "TK-player-4015_f",
  "You mean... the spacetime turbulence... erased most of the land and civilization?": "TK-player-4010_f",
  "See the purple dream bloom here? Its fruit emits a sleeping gas if you hit it hard enough!": "TK-302-3019",
  "Can you explain what exactly is the Cataclysm?": "TK-player-4009_f",
  "Have you run into any difficulties?": "TK-player-1391_f",
  "Bounty Missions": "TK-option-010",
  "There's a plant called Mistbloom on Raincaller Island that I can use to make improvised smoke bombs! That will give us cover from the blasters!": "TK-302-3071",
  "Not good. She overloaded her suppressor to create the shield. It's really taking a toll on her body.": "TK-013-1039",
  "I think I have a good grasp of what transpired now. Our forensics team is analyzing the scene as we speak, and might be able to find something of value.": "TK-V103-0024",
  "(sighs) I'm fully aware of the situation. It seems <blue>Samir</> has played us all for fools... It was another prank all along.": "TK-101-1057",
  "I know, the current situation is not looking too hopeful. We've underestimated the enemy's strength in this region.": "TK-104-5001",
  "The information is encrypted. We'll have to ask Franz to help us interpret it.": "TK-player-5078_f",
  "Intel indicates the Heirs of Aida has stepped up operations in the area recently, so be careful. I await your good news.": "TK-104-4040",
  "The intelligence mentions that a time engine prototype was stored here, but the machine lacked some key components and was written off as a faulty device that couldn't be used.": "TK-002-5050",
  "There are many technical details mentioned in the intelligence—stuff that goes far beyond my comprehension. We'll have to find someone who knows more to take a look at it.": "TK-002-5053",
  "Information? Uh, I should let the doctor know first.": "TK-player-3089_f",
  "You're free to do what you want!": "npc_book5_834",
  "Want some inside dope? Pretty cheap.": "npc_book4_501",
  "You want to go back, then?": "npc_book5_810",
  "Maybe she saw how bad I was, and decided to mess up to look worse than me.": "v60400-TK-109-025",
  "Want to know the secret? 100 push-ups and 100 sit-ups a day, plus...": "TK-039-1002",
  "If you wanted to undergo this surgery, you'd have to volunteer to be the subject in the experiment. But for that girl, it was her one chance to be saved.": "npc_book3_722",
  "I want to keep something as a souvenir...": "TK-V114-0044",
  "Go ask him yourself. I just want to leave here, the sooner the better.": "TK-313-3084",
  "To unlock Originum enhancement, your suppressor must be at <blue>V1.4</>. I got some upgrade materials here. Take them.": "TK-002-1121",
  "Want to talk to him? You can find him in the stands before the match.": "TK-KING-1012",
  "Anything you want to say?": "npc_book5_804",
  "It's better than I thought.": "TK-V114-0036",
  "An accident?": "v21TK-player-V003_f",
  "You mean... The bad guys took the Doctor to the house up ahead?": "TK-player-5046_f",
  "Meaning... You want me to do it?": "TK-player-2085_f",
  "We'll talk about your grateful hearts another day! I just want to know if you've seen Claire! Dr. Claire!": "TK-player-5033_f",
  "It's hard to imagine... Didn't Samir come?": "TK-player-2216_f",
  "Thank you for your hard work and sacrifices fighting out there. We will repay your efforts through our actions.": "TK-V117-p102",
  "Thank you for everything you've done, Executor from Aesperia. Our research would have gone nowhere without you.": "TK-V250-083",
  "And thank you for your support. You are always welcome in Banges, my friend.": "q204009_00_p",
  "Thank you for retrieving our signal amplifier. Once we set up the amplifier in a higher location, we should be able to locate the captain's transponder.": "q501001_02_01",
  "Thank you! Thank you!": "TK-301-1035",
  "Hold just a minute, I never said I have the Astrum.": "TK-2006-1014",

  "My. Name. Is. Mi-a!": "TK-V105-0012",
  "I...": "v21TK-V107-0008",

  "I need some time to myself.": "npc_book5_555",
  "Much better... And you are?": "TK-player-1001_f",
  "I already handed the Astrum over to the Heirs of Aida. I had no choice since they have hostages.": "TK-207-1025",
  "I... I like it...": "TK-V114-0037",
  "I... I want to become someone like you. I want to help the shelter!": "TK-010-1096",
  "Okay, I'll talk! The Ravagers plan to destroy the surface Omnium station and cut off Cetus Island's power supply!": "TK-311-3047",
  "I don't understand.": "TK-player-1051_f",
  "I don't know... Mr. Alan said if the supplies from Banges make it here on time, they will be saved, but now...": "TK-224-2025",
  "Then I'll... I'll get right back up again!": "TK-010-1113",
  "I... Alright...": "TK-003-1066",
  "I... I'm going to see a friend I haven't seen in a long time...": "TK-player-4058_f",

  "I... I just wanted to see the stars...": "TK-010-1149",
  "I... I only remember a guy with a big head making a lot of noise. I think he had just been caught and was losing it, big time.": "TK-302-5006",
  "I don't quite understand. What is the Omnium Tower for?": "TK-player-1264_f",
  "I... I think I had a dream. I saw a lot of things in this dream, but my memory... is slowly blurring.": "TK-010-5001",
  "I-I'm not a crybaby! I'm not a baby anymore!": "TK-Food001-1004",
  "I... I'm not frowning! Nothing happened... Just that there are too many things to do...": "TK-Food001-1002",
  "I get it! I don't remember having this conversation at all!": "TK-410-4015",
  "I, uh, forgot my luggage! Yeah, luggage! I'll go as soon as I get it.": "TK-311-3010",
  "Wait, I'm here to trade for protection! How can you lock me up? Not fair!": "TK-311-3051",
  "I really know nothing about that! My uncle had researchers develop it. I'm only responsible for the distribution...": "TK-402-4025",
  "Eh... I know I tend to get like that sometimes... He-he...": "TK-203-1020",
  "I... I don't know... I can't remember...": "TK-player-1324_f",

  "I heard everything.": "npc_book5_806",
  "I... First, I hope I can find my brother as soon as possible and reunite with everyone from the shelter.\r\n\r\nAnd I hope I can learn to live with myself, accept myself, and make use of my abilities.

  "I've been busy and didn't see anyone with that description.": "npc_book5_5e",
  "I've wanted to find her all this time. I even joined Hykros as an Executor on my own account, but maybe she...": "TK-1103-1028",
  "Louder, so everyone in Hykros will know we've got an Heirs of Aida spy here!": "TK-player-1102_f",
  "I'll never forget it.": "TK-option-249",
  "I disagree.": "npc_book6_125b",

  "Nope.": "npc_book5_418",

  "I don't know how they're planning to save her, but even if they did... Would Shirli still be the same Shirli that we knew?": "TK-002-1138",
  "I don't know what your cyborg buddy did to your little sister. Their techniques are rather advanced, but also rather... intrusive.": "TK-313-3015",
  "I don't know if she suffered internal injuries to her organs and brain. Don't move her until I can evaluate her condition.": "TK-013-1040",
  "I don't know where Franz is. He just sent me some coordinates, but I can't reach him.": "TK-003-5013",
  "I don't know how to describe it... But it's a very different feeling from what I remember. It's almost too delicate or sharp.": "v60400-TK-106-035",
  "I don't know. However, in the message she left, she said there was something she needed inside the Confounding Abyss. She knew very well how treacherous that place was, and I believe she had taken all precautions.": "v21TK-V107-0047",
  "I don't know. I hope that madman can't start the time engine yet. Either way, time is running out. We can't afford to plan this right now—let's split up.": "TK-001-5019",
  "I don't know, but she's the one who asked us to come here. What could she be thinking...?": "TK-1103-1049",

  "I didn't find Franz, only a damaged communicator. Do you think he might be in trouble?": "TK-player-5080_f",
  "I have no more questions.": "TK-option-174",
  "I didn't exactly get to meet them. I only requested their help via a communication device, and they said that they would.": "TK-player-1307_f",
  "I don't have to time to explain it to you. A lot of the men were captured, and if anyone should rat you out...": "TK-player-1096_f",
  "I sent someone to collect the data from the several monitoring stations outside the camp. Fortunately, we have located the whereabouts of the stolen Astrum.": "TK-401-4025",
  "My father used to be one of them. When I was young, he died at the hands of Hykros.": "TK-001-5003",
  "My dad is his boss. He's loyal to him and has been trying to find me...": "npc_book5_514",
  "I'm guessing the Hyenas are responsible. They harassed us from all angles and seized considerable land from us.": "TK-401-4010",
  "I believe this special energy-matter is what sustains the Grayspace Entities. They are unlike us, humans... They don't need to turn food into energy.": "v21TK-V128-0006",
  "Go away, I'm busy right now.": "TK-V112-p100",
  "I'm too busy to open the door for you now. There's a spare keycard under the flower pot outside. Just use it to come in.": "TK-cobalt-1012",
  "I'm afraid I can't give a clear answer to that right now, though Buru is actively collecting and analyzing the data. I'll be sure to let you know the second I have any further information.": "TK-V101-0005",
  "I'll go to Astra to investigate right away. You head back to Hykros to report the situation to Elric. I have a bad feeling about this...": "TK-002-5033",
  "I can't leave, not yet... Wait, you say you're an Executor? Perfect! You've come at just the right time!": "q501004_02_03",
  "I've got urgent business to tend to. I'll see you later, Mina.": "TK-player-1126_f",
  "I've still got urgent business to tend to. Once I'm done, I'll take you to see Layla, okay?": "TK-player-1117_f",
  "I even suspect that he is the one close to obtaining eternity.": "TK-104-4031",
  "I'm even worried if she's been so busy that she's forgotten about it... Tell her that it's a commission from Dr. Joaquin. She should remember.": "TK-101-1085",
  "I requested a new suppressor for you. It's equipped with the latest <blue>gene lock</> technology. The model you got is obsolete and cannot be upgraded further.": "TK-101-1024",
  "I'll stay behind to alert people. It's dangerous for anyone to use the spacerift right now.": "TK-cici-1005",
  "My <blue>pot</> is just over there. See the <blue>fish</> in the river? Fill your belly with them.": "TK-002-1006",
  "One of my informants is in trouble. His last message mentioned that Heirs of Aida activity has been detected in Astra, and now I'm starting to worry.": "TK-002-5032",
  "I failed my mission, so they're of no use to me. I hope you'll succeed.": "TK-huasheng-1007",

  "My wish? That everybody here will live in peace and harmony.": "TK-046-1008",
  "It's not serious. I'll be all right. You pass it on and they'll come help me.": "TK-409-4008",
  "My goal is to become a good and reasonable person like Director Eva!": "TK-V102-p103",
  "They nabbed my cousin, Iron Fist, while he was making a delivery!": "TK-311-3066",
  "My view is, even if the reassembled you are totally new, as long as you don't feel that way and no one else does, either, it's moot.": "npc_book6_123",
  "My memory, in some parts, is still fuzzy.": "TK-010-1221",
  "I don't have a good memory.": "TK-0292-1002",

  "Yes, I see it. But it looks some sort of... projection?": "TK-player-1172_f",
  "I read something about controlling aberrations and immediately thought of Hykros, so I downloaded the file and sent it.": "npc_book_3_205",
  "I haven't seen you before. Is this your first time here? Wanna give it a shot? All the competitors here are the best of the best!": "TK-0051-1003",
  "Let's see... Forty years ago was when the Heirs of Aida first got active.": "npc_book_3_503",
  "Let me see. Hmm... This appears to be something that my grandfather entrusted me to protect.": "q204007-1",
  "I really can't think of anything else that could be of help... I didn't notice anything abnormal when I tried it here yesterday.": "TK-1102-1001",
  "I see. I'm sorry about not paying attention to others while playing.": "v60400-TK-114-012",
  "Okay. I got this.": "TK-001-3011",
  "I got it. I didn't ask for any of these additional things. I just need to make sure that the basic functions are stable.": "TK-101-1090",
  "I hear you. About that... Its production is in full swing and has entered the final stage.": "TK-cobalt-1030",
  "I know you've been looking for clues about me.": "TK-baiyuekui-1005",
  "But I think I know what you're asking.": "q204006_02_16",
  "I know you're working for Hykros now... but you'll always be one of us.": "TK-003-1135",
  "I know, but I can't just go back now.": "npc_book5_827",
  "That's not the only thing I know. Heirs of Aida got a spy on the docks. Too bad he got away before security could get there.": "TK-002-2005",
  "I know I really shouldn't trouble everyone with this, but I just... worry about my brother so much.": "TK-010-V001",
  "I know this might seem rude, but can you help the locals here? The disease is making all of our lives more miserable...": "TK-413-4002",
  "I know it's a castle in the sky, but the dream is what we need the most now.": "TK-207-1074",
  "I know of an old warehouse nearby. We might as well try there first... I mean, what do we have to lose?": "TK-002-5018",
  "I know how dangerous this is going to be, but someone has to do it. If you don't want to, I'll go by myself!": "TK-101-6-6002",
  "Oh, I know what's wrong. I found out that its internal projection device is broken. It's probably the prism inside.": "TK-010-1089",
  "I know I'm a terrible person for doing this to you. Hiding things from you all along, leaving you alone in this world... I've been incredibly selfish, but I wanted to prove our theory at all costs, and I was willing to make any sacrifice necessary to accomplish that goal. I wanted to see the full potential of our experiment, to see if we could rewind time to before the Cataclysm and prevent it from ever happening. I wanted to free the world of Omnium's scourge, and put an end to all the strife, the rivalry, and the hatred... In a world like that, no one would need to wear suppressors anymore; they could live their lives freely and happily, without the threat of aberration or death, and the land could return to normal. Isn't that the reason we continue with our research, to make it happen? No one else is going to realize our dream for us, Claire; it's up to us to travel back in time, and bring beauty and life back to this broken world.": "letter-03",
  "I know, you're here to see someone. But you asked the wrong guys. Uncle Ray and Moto have no idea who Sean is.": "TK-226-5003",
  "I know, but, looking at the way Shirli is now... I didn't have a choice.": "TK-001-5007",
  "I knew it... The Sage lied to me. I thought they just wanted to destroy the Tower of Fantasy, so we could completely get rid of Omnium. But, in fact...": "TK-001-5002",
  "I know. After all, I saw your exchange with her just now.": "TK-1103-1003",
  "I just realized you're a dead ringer for a little girl I met on Astra named Layla. She's an adorable, vivacious kid, probably a bit older than you. Do you live in Hykros with your parents, Mina?": "TK-player-1124_f",
  "I'll get on it at once.": "TK-option-253",
  "That house is where I met her for the first time.": "npc_book_2_301",
  "I can't wait that long.": "TK-option-187",
  "I promised Dr. Joaquin that I would pick up the goods for him as soon as possible. I could accompany you if I could be of help.": "TK-player-1412_f",
  "Fine, Doctor. I will take responsibility for everything.": "TK-001-3014",
  "Now I understand the doctor's attitude toward you.": "TK-player-4006_f",
  "I gave them the medicine they wanted, so they can go back to work with hope. We take what we need. That's the best outcome anyone could ever hope for.": "TK-401-4020",
  "I handed all reigns to Giggs, making him responsible for the entire operation there. Who knew my nephew would do such a thing?": "TK-401-4033",
  "So I thought about it for a long time and finally decided to not tell her mother the truth.": "npc_book3_729",
  "I've considered that myself. If it's true, I'm afraid...": "TK-V103-0004",
  "How can I help?": "TK-player-1012_f",
  "I could feel that there was no emotion in her eyes, she was just a tool used to faithfully execute orders.": "Tk-010-1235",
  "I can feel there's special energy within this space that is slowly being absorbed by me. This feeling... is becoming more and more tangible.": "v21TK-V128-0005",
  "I can take care of myself, don't you worry about me. Head through the mountain pass up ahead, and you should be able to see the Omnium Tower. Have a safe trip!": "TK-503-5009",
  "The Hyenas are trying to kill me!": "npc_book5_102",
  "I want you to deliver an important shipment, but the buyer and I... Well, had a few misunderstandings, so I shouldn't show my face.": "TK-2006-1016",
  "I want to shut off the Omnium Tower...": "TK-option-096",
  "I'm going to Hykros and inform them of everything that happened here. Maybe they can help... Anyway, I'll see you.": "TK-002-1163",
  "I'll check for other clues. You keep an eye on Giggs and let me know if any news broke.": "TK-002-1189",
  "I want to join.": "TK-option-273",
  "So how can I prove myself?": "TK-player-2089_f",
  "I'm here to rescue President Kolador and Theo.": "TK-option-056",
  "I need to be in an optimal condition at all times to prepare for the upcoming action.": "TK-v108-P105",
  "I need to know President Kolador and Theo's locations. Any clues?": "TK-player-2057_f",
  "I want to keep going.": "TK-option-138",
  "I saw a girl in green jacket with short hair. She went to the inn but didn't stay.": "npc_book5_5b",
  "I'm warning you, if you dare tell Giggs about this...": "TK-player-4078_f",
  "I know him. Leave it to me.": "npc_book3_750",
  "I know your uncle. I'll talk to him in detail later. I've still got important business to tend to. We'll do the riddles later. Bye, Mina.": "TK-player-1120_f",
  "I remember... in my dreams... There's red-eye... in the sky.": "v21TK-V113-0001",
  "I remember setting up a cannon near here for this very situation, but I can't remember where it is exactly.": "TK-002-5011",
  "Let me try... Nope, my battery doesn't work.": "npc_book_306",
  "That's all I have to say. Let's get down to business.": "TK-314-1011",
  "So where should I begin looking?": "TK-player-1352_f",
  "Where should I start?": "TK-player-5054_f",
  "Where can I find them?": "TK-option-224",
  "Should I tell Hykros the truth?": "TK-player-4104_f",
  "What should I do?": "TK-option-216",
  "How can I contact her?": "TK-player-5005_f",
  "Tell you what... Haven't you realized that the source of your crisis... could be me?": "TK-V111-p102",
  "I said I don't know him. Do what you will with that stuff.": "npc_book4_625",
  "I told you Prynce is a nice guy.": "npc_book5_807",
  "I was talking about instructions from Eason, not the trivial stuff you said.": "TK-player-1133_f",
  "I did make it clear you're responsible for all my personal losses in this experiment!": "TK-313-3045",
  "I said it was a two-way street, or did you really think you could trade for Astrum with a mere handful of iron ore?": "TK-2006-1015",
  "Okay, okay! I did sell it to Banges, but I'm just the middleman.": "TK-410-4012",
  "After looking into the access history for the Simulacrum database, I cross-referenced all high-level accounts with data-modification privileges against the possible time at which the data was tampered with.": "TK-101-1048",
  "Let me tell you, it's weird! Franken and his men were trapped in the moment when the machine turned on!": "TK-311-3026",
  "I'm not with them... Don't hit me!": "TK-311-3002",
  "Not on me, but I can try my friends back in the shelter.": "npc_book_308",
  "I let Anna down. I let everyone down...": "TK-207-1019",
  "I'm not entirely sure that Kim has anything to do with this. Giggs was responsible for the research, development, and production of the drug. He seems to have made contact with the Heirs of Aida behind Kim's back.": "TK-002-4012",
  "I'm not worried. There's enough reserve on this island to last a whole year. Worse comes to worst, I'll just move to a new island.": "TK-313-3057",
  "And here I thought you were gonna keep it a secret.": "TK-002-1152",
  "I'm here to pay my debt.": "TK-option-164",
  "I also heard... the voices of strangers... many of them. When I got close to the machine, their voices filled my mind...": "TK-010-5003",
  "This is the first time I've seen so much info on the Grayspace Entities.": "v21TK-010-Vp003",
  "I've got stuff to do...": "TK-option-055",
  "I still have other works to do, so please excuse me. You can take a look around. Contact me if you have any questions.": "TK-207-1089",
  "I've still got work to do, so I gotta run. Look around if you'd like.": "TK-207-1060",
  "I have to finish the opening ceremony preparations. Please, excuse me.": "TK-207-1120",
  "I haven't even said anything!": "v60400-TK-player-073",
  "I haven't even said anything!_f": "v60400-TK-player-073_f",
  "(sighs deeply) I need your help again. There's someone. Someone who may have a way of saving Shirli.": "TK-001-1050",
  "I still remember it. That girl... After listening to me, she lowered her head and was quiet for a long time.": "npc_book3_725",
  "I need to keep trying harder.": "TK-vplayer-Vp206_f",
  "I'm leaving right now.": "TK-player-5056_f",
  "I'm on my way!": "TK-player-1191_f",
  "I'll send you the coordinates, but you got to hurry. The Hyenas are leaving with it!": "TK-402-4007",
  "My, but that is hardly news at all. We find all manner of strange things in the Mines every day.": "q204001_02_05",
  "I'll give you a bit of insider info: there's even more entertainment to come! You're going to love it.": "TK-cobalt-1099",
  "I got some talisman here to keep you safe. I'll even sell it to you cheap!": "TK-410-4003",
  "I didn't even get a chance to see it, and you already got your own property... I'm green with envy.": "TK-203-1088",
  "I just learned the running away part myself... And I have no way of knowing whether you're telling the truth.": "npc_book5_420",
  "I followed Spark and ran... ran... ran... But then Spark disappeared... I was all alone...": "v21TK-V113-0003",
  "I made the round, but not sure if I fixed it.": "TK-player-2020",
  "I made the rounds, but I'm not sure if I fixed them...": "TK-player-2020_f",
  "I've been here all day, and I haven't caught sight of any merchant ships entering the port. Just last year, it was packed around this time!": "TK-203-1002",
  "I reassessed the energy needed for the whole experiment. Simply put, what I got on hand is far short of the mark.": "TK-313-3018",
  "I spoke to some of the people in headquarters. They said my father met with a stranger once in the middle of the night... A stranger who apparently resembled Zeke very much.": "TK-216-1028",
  "I spoke to some of the people in headquarters. They said my father met with a stranger once... A stranger who apparently resembled Zeke very much.": "TK-216-1017",
  "I need an answer.": "TK-V114-P128",
  "I need you to place an aiming beacon at the Omnium Tower to guide the shell to its target.": "TK-002-5027",
  "I need to prepare.": "TKS-Vplayer-015_f",
  "I need to find a doctor... For my child! My child!": "npc_book3_102",
  "I can certainly sympathize. The doctor... The whole \"Listener\" research team, has been waiting for this day for a very long time.": "TK-V107-0096",
  "Ouch!": "TK-option-108",
  "I, I don't know...": "TK-V113-p105",
  "That's what I heard his friends calling him when they were after me...": "npc_book5_505",
  "I-I'm fine. This brat... (sighs) I found this note in the ribbons. It has the address of the Banges Inn written on it.": "TK-1103-1010",
  "Come on, I apologized... Stop mocking me!": "npc_book5_520",
  "Me?": "TK-player-1075_f",
  "Me? I'm... great. How've these geezers been treating you?": "TK-002-1042",
  "Me? Situation?": "TK-player-3078_f",
  "Me? I'd probably pack things up and run.": "TK-002-3011",
  "Me? What should I do?": "TK-player-1249_f",
  "Or... perhaps you're willing to take the risk and drive this mecha into the camp yourself. I can provide you with technical support... How about that?": "TK-417-4010",
  "Or... we are the ones that were erased, we were isolated from our world.": "TK-104-4027",
  "Or maybe they're plotting something even bigger.": "TK-cici-3021",
  "Lunatic is more like it. Dealing with someone like her is almost impossible.": "TK-1103-1012",
  "Or... could I say that you acquiesced in Giggs' action?": "TK-player-4102_f",
  "Or, you can do what I did, activate a reversed time engine, create your own dimension out of the time spiral. It's like a Chrono Chamber.": "TK-313-3064",
  "Or, you can try your luck with Hamlin. He might have a way to get you up there, though you probably have to grease his palm a little.": "TK-401-4041",
  "Perhaps he knows it in his own heart. But as long as there is a glimmer of hope, he will do whatever it takes, even if it costs his own life.": "TK-002-2122",
  "Perhaps it isn't very appropriate for me to say that from our standpoint.": "TK-V116-p101",
  "Maybe you can ask the mechanic from Aesperia?": "v60400-TK-107-049",
  "They may be at the very top of the Grayspace Entity ecosystem and are far superior to other Grayspace Entities.": "TK-V250-065",
  "Perhaps Grayspace Entities have their own ecosystem that we have yet to understand.": "TK-V250-062",
  "Maybe it's still not too late.": "TK-player-1273_f",
  "It's not correct to say \"buried here\" since there's nothing but dirt underneath.": "npc_book_2_316",
  "Diana loves Pelo. If something happens to him because of this surgery... I can't imagine it.": "npc_book3_736",
  "Real estate?": "TK-option-156",
  "As such, Mr. Schudy will go with you—the new smart servant of Hykros. It features a specialized function which can help you survive the harsh radiation there.": "TK-101-1040",
  "As such...": "q204001_02_11",
  "So... that's why it's called the Confounding Abyss.": "v21TK-010-V013",
  "So, after you get your hands on it, can you let me take a look at it first?": "TK-417-4018",
  "So you're here to buy it from me, right?": "npc_book_3_311",
  "That's why I hugged Mi-a just then, hehe.": "TK-V113-p109",
  "Thus, just... teach them a lesson and take back what they robbed, that will do.": "TK-304-3010",
  "So, before the Mirroria reclaimers arrive, I'd like you to look after this egg. Samir and I will go explore the area.": "TK-1103-V004",
  "She was exiled from the village to live alone in that crappy house.": "npc_book_2_310",
  "So...?": "TK-V107-0059",
  "We'll need to make sure we don't miss out. Hee-hee.": "TK-203-1135",
  "We would like to find out more from the civilian.": "npc_book_3_009",
  "So we're here in case it gets out of control?": "TK-V107-0086",
  "So... I want to start a band.": "v60400-TK-107-013",
  "So, I took Shirli to Astra to escape all this—to find a place to live in peace, but...": "TK-001-5005",
  "So, I was hoping you two could tag along. Apart from helping with security, you'd be able to learn first-hand the very latest research results, which should help your understanding of the Grayspace Entities.": "TK-V107-0082",
  "And that's why it's so hard for you to make friends, Palu.": "TK-002-1022",
  "So I need to be at my best during each practice.": "v60400-TK-108-016",
  "So now I feel a bit lost.": "npc_book3_734",
  "Mr. Alan said the uninjured and those who are able to work have the priority on meds and energy cells so the shelter can survive.": "TK-226-5009",
  "Could the Heirs of Aida be behind the Ravagers' attack?": "TK-003-1110",
  "So the opponents this time are those things you created, aren't they?": "TK-KING-1032",
  "So, Mi-a will not be afraid of being repaired.": "TK-VMi-a-p102",
  "So you're asking me for help for a... concert?": "v60400-TK-112-016",
  "So if you can't make a clean kill in one go, you must quickly evacuate from the gorger's range of attack.": "TK-baiyuekui-1014",
  "So, young one, would you keep the story for me? Remember her, remember the tomb.": "npc_book_2_409",
  "As a safety precaution, we had to vent excess energy to the surface at the cost of causing a certain degree of radiation damage. This is not a permanent solution.": "TK-102-1024",
  "So I hope to ask you to speak to your friends to see if they're interested? Could you?": "v60400-TK-107-017",
  "Please, help me! It will be okay once I get to Banges.": "npc_book5_110",
  "I need to keep going forward, and I believe I can do it if you're with me.": "v60400-TK-106-019",
  "So... I'll head back in a while! Remember the shooting booth on the way? I plan to try my luck there and get some gifts for them.": "TK-1103-1087",
  "In other words, the current state of Mirroria relies on the delicate balance between the Confounding Abyss and our reality, but that also makes Mirroria a prisoner to the Confounding Abyss.": "v21TK-V107-0060",
  "All the gorgers have been eliminated. The threat to the ecology of Aida has been lifted. The mission went very well. You really helped us out, Executor.": "TK-marc-34",
  "Everything was going smoothly, and well before all contact was suddenly lost. No communication, no responses. Everything just went dead. The people, the equipment... there's no sign of either.": "v21TK-V107-0052",
  "A handwritten diary. Sorry, it's been so long, I forget what it looks like exactly.": "npc_book_2_113",

  "It's not your fault. Her condition's worse than we thought. I should've been watchful.": "TK-001-1047",
  "This is not your problem.": "TK-player-1272_f",
  "It's not yours?": "npc_book_2_205a",
  "That sounds similar... Ah, Samuel?": "npc_book4_310",
  "Well, I saw you coming, didn't I? I can relax now, you've got this.": "TK-1103s-V008",
  "Now, I've started a small business around here with my cousin, Iron Fist.": "TK-311-3064",
  "I sense someone's here, like flies after rotting flesh.": "TK-313-3066",
  "They claimed a special med is coming our way today, so we've waited since morning... But guess what?": "TK-404-4004",
  "Does it do more than just protecting us from radiation...?": "TK-player-1236_f",
  "These two are still going...": "TK-cici-5017",
  "I invited these two to experience our Graceday, so I must ensure they enjoy themselves. Do me a favor and let us try the festival specials in advance, will you? Please!": "TK-203-1131",
  "These two are guests from District 9. They have a smart servant, Mi-a, with a damaged language module. We were hoping you could take a look.": "TK-V107-0020",
  "Where are these two sites?": "TK-player-1073_f",
  "These two creatures basically won't attack people because they have mild personalities, which means it won't be too difficult to investigate them. You can treat this as a practice to help you get used to installing the equipment.": "TK-V250-013",
  "Both these creatures are herbivores that have water-storing organs, drought-resistant skin, and thick hooves that are not afraid of the scalding sand.": "TK-V250-019",
  "Unlike the two herbivorous creatures, these creatures are more fierce and are difficult to track as they are rarely seen.": "TK-V250-026",
  "Hmm, okay. Come see me at Banges Headquarters tomorrow. I'll find a way to make it happen.": "TK-216-1019",
  "Uh... Doesn't it stop working if you tell someone your wish?": "TK-010-1252",
  "This world could've been perfect.": "TK-046-1010",
  "Will it be difficult to fix?": "TK-010-1073",
  "I'll leave the parts to you. And I'll locate the cannon first.": "TK-002-5015",
  "What's with that package?": "TK-player-1370_f",
  "That... You can trace it back to the history of the port.": "npc_book6_312",

  "I know the circuits for this room and I can open that door over there, but the guards outside, however...": "TK-021-q102022-1005",
  "It was found in the wreckage of the Banges carrier that crash-landed in the Crown Mines. I thought I should ask you about it.": "q204007_00_03",
  "Is this true?": "TK-vplayer-Vp211_f",
  "Is this dirigible safe?": "TK-player-3013_f",
  "The intruder... Could it have been Samir?": "TK-player-1385",
  "The hacker... Could it have been Samir?": "TK-player-1385_f",
  "They're beyond hope. They're just a band of unreasonable outlaws. I don't want to be like them! My dad has to let me quit the Hyenas!": "npc_book5_527",
  "Everyone in this shelter has their own secret. When some secrets are secrets no more, there may be no need for the shelter.": "TK-006-1003",
  "This door was originally camouflaged as a cover. I've unlocked it in advance, so you can enter directly.": "TK-cobalt-1052",
  "This!": "v60400-TK-mia-004",
  "Which is—remembering a sad past, and celebrating a happier present.": "TK-207-1116",
  "All these years, I've thought about it over and over again... Accidents never have just one cause, but this one... It seems as though every single person was involved in this accident, every step of the way, as it led to this final conclusion.": "q204006_02_09",
  "All these years, I've wished for a chance to make amends with her.": "q204013_00_07",
  "This should be enough. Now watch me go to work!": "TK-302-3074",
  "How did the Doctor capture these Grayspace Entities?": "v21TK-124-Vp002",
  "The welcome wagon's here already? I can't say I'm surprised.": "TK-002-5035",
  "This might seem a little hasty, but I want to make her wish come true, and give her a birthday that she will never forget.": "v60400-TK-107-015",
  "It's that straightforward?": "npc_book3_807",
  "Why the secrecy?": "TK-option-213",
  "It'll be a great present for her.": "v60400-TK-player-019",
  "It'll be a great present for her._f": "v60400-TK-player-019_f",
  "This is one of the common scenes in our desert.": "TK-V250-023",
  "That's the result of years of Hykros research on how fragile Aidans can co-exist with Omnium.": "TK-104-1008",
  "I'm doing this as atonement for the foolish acts I did as a father. It's also why I called you here.": "TK-207-1071",
  "This is about the Heirs of Aida.": "npc_book_3_317",
  "I already know about all this. Palu found a video of the Heirs of Aida in the shelter.": "TK-player-5063_f",
  "Are these Originum going to Hykros?": "TK-player-1248_f",
  "Thanks to you, we've managed to update the information on these native creatures!": "TK-V250-032",
  "Over the years, the levels of Omnium radiation have shown a marked decline in the Vera region. People no longer need to rely on various support devices to survive.": "TK-V104-0008",
  "I'll check all those places, and hopefully we'll find Theo and others.": "TK-player-2080_f",
  "The Astrum is very important to me.": "TK-player-2090_f",
  "These samples are priceless. By studying them, we can gain a deeper understanding of both Abyssant biological traits and Field abilities. Perhaps, one day, we too will be able to control space.": "TK-V103-0008",
  "If you wish to know more about the origin and behavior of these creatures, mere observation would not be enough. Please kill some Grayspace Entities and bring us more detailed data.": "TK-V250-052",
  "The gene segments of these viruses have been artificially modified to contain a certain genetic sequence.": "TK-002-4008",
  "Where did the drugs come from? Why would Giggs want you to sell them to Banges?": "TK-player-4077_f",
  "These medicines seem to contain only common chemical compounds, but Dr. Henry also extracted a small amount of inactivated virus from some samples.": "TK-002-4007",
  "Wherever there are spider jumpers you can almost be certain that the Heirs of Aida are close by.": "TK-002-5006",
  "This is simply unbelievable.": "TK-player-3063_f",
  "About this... Few people in Mirroria know this, but you should know about the \"Second City,\" right?": "v21TK-V107-0049",
  "About that... Give me time to consider. Actually, I came here to looking into a case with Mr. Franz, but now...": "TK-player-1061_f",
  "Don't inform Mr. Kim yet. We must have concrete proof first before moving on.": "TK-002-4016",
  "Let's bring things to a close, for now. Thank you for all your hard work; I will apprise you of any new developments in the future.": "TK-101-1073",
  "We'll worry about that later. Let's get you out of here!": "TK-player-2115_f",
  "I can help you. Do you know where they were taken?": "TK-player-5004_f",
  "I concealed it not because I have an agenda or harbor ill will. There are just some things that I feel are not... ready for the public eye.": "v21TK-V107-0005",
  "I'm not sure what the consequences of this scheme might be. If something goes wrong, it's likely that... we may see another cataclysm, or even worse.": "TK-313-5008",
  "We can't afford to delay this matter any longer. I'll go back to Hykros right away, and you go find Dr. Claire. We have to find out the details of their plan as soon as possible.": "TK-002-5054",
  "It's a long story... Mirroria launched a special Grayspace Entity research project a few years back, codenamed \"Listener.\"": "TK-V107-0078",
  "It's critical for me to get the necessary Astrum to turn off that tower, so I hope you can help.": "TK-player-2114_f",
  "I have my own thoughts on this, but I can assure you that Ruby will be safe. Captain Saki Fuwa, with me.": "v21TK-V103-0019",
  "The information has been encrypted multiple times. It'll take some time to fully decode it, but I can already see that it mentions a specific location often, and it's somewhere nearby.": "TK-002-5047",
  "This is the one I mentioned to you, my savior! You should show your respect! Bow down to your new savior!": "TK-311-3076",
  "This is my new friend from Astra who volunteered to help fix the <blue>lanterns</>!": "TK-203-1039",
  "Thank you for saving Gus. He's lucky to be alive.": "TK-407-4003",
  "You'll have to ask him that yourself. That's all I know, not that I dare ask more questions!": "TK-410-4014",
  "Is that what Karl had in mind?": "TK-player-4008_f",
  "This is an abandoned lab I found when I was a child. In those early years, I repaired and rebuilt all the machines inside once. It kind of became my personal secret base.": "TK-cobalt-1048",
  "Rules? I'll just tell you the most important one 'cuz I hate chit-chat.": "TK-KING-1003",
  "The bio-samples in these cultivation tanks were taken from a defeated powerful Abyssant. We call them \"Crystamaxes,\" and they are crucial to the Field ability of an Abyssant. Each one has its own unique characteristics, so the Field ability of each Abyssant will likewise be different.": "TK-V103-0007",
  "This \"hand\"... Let's put you down first.": "TK-010-V034",
  "It's just my speculation, and she will never admit it.": "v60400-TK-109-027",
  "This is only temporary. It is only a matter of time before the gorger survives because of its strong regenerative ability.": "TK-marc-04",
  "This is not just about saving your sister. If this experiment fails, who knows what the consequences might be...?": "TK-313-3030",
  "That's not befitting of a true leader. Alright, I got it. I'll put the word out.": "TK-207-1037",
  "Cash and carry is the black market way of doing business.": "npc_book_3_325",
  "You asked for it!": "TK-0091-1005",
  "This is a special rune made by Hykros and guaranteed to work. If you're still not sure, I got other stuff I can show you.": "TK-410-4005",
  "This abandoned drone has only 30% energy remaining. To ensure your safety, I will continuously provide energy as you go. Please be sure to maintain the drone's energy for flight functionality.": "TK-574-1015",
  "I fixed the antique, but we don't have enough energy to start it up.": "TK-010-1083",
  "This deconstructor is an old model manufactured by Banges Tech. It's not too complicated, so I think I can fix it.": "TK-010-1079",
  "This place is filled with all kinds of stuff, which obviously can be sold since they're just sitting here. I don't know what she's thinking.": "TK-KING-1046",
  "How come it's so dark and creepy here... Er...": "v21TK-124-Vp001",
  "I haven't been to this place in quite a while, but I still remember where the Omnium Tower is. Come with me.": "TK-002-5036",
  "It's for a kid's birthday. Will that help?": "v60400-TK-player-069",
  "It's for a kid's birthday. Will that help?_f": "v60400-TK-player-069_f",
  "The disturbance has finally been quelled.": "TK-101-1107",
  "The Grayspace Entities near the rift have all been dealt with. I have orders to remain here and see that the rift closes.": "TK-V108-0003",
  "This set of Simulacrum equipment is the latest invention of Hykros. It will better assist you with the coming combat scenarios!": "TK-121-1048",
  "Where did this come from? Do I need to expose you?": "v60400-TK-109-002",
  "This guy hurried me to pick an instrument, eager to form a band... Only to find out that we have no place to practice.": "v60400-TK-109-011",
  "This is a very rare and potentially valuable opportunity for us. Dr. Clive hopes the three of you might attend.": "TK-V103-0020",
  "So that's why you and the doctor keep talking about things that happened half a century ago, yet you still look young?": "TK-player-4007_f",
  "Is this the one you rescued? How are we feeling today?": "TK-003-1079",
  "This is why I wanted you to upgrade the suppressor...": "TK-player-1185_f",
  "This is the new place we've arrived at. Vera... Mirroria...": "TK-V106-p100",
  "This is the master AI for the Control Center. When the mainframe is completed, you'll have access to all of the features.": "TK-207-1050",
  "It was devious! How was I to know it would pull a stunt like that? Let me have another go, I'll whack it right upside its head!": "TK-1103s-V011",
  "This is Beta. It monitors and relays various environmental data on the island to assist the system administrator.": "TK-207-1083",
  "Is this the egg? It's enormous...": "TK-010-V027",
  "And that's the risk. Only by lifting it can I even try to reverse the aberration. But if it fails, she will get worse.": "TK-313-3017",
  "It depends on what you want. I know everything that happens in the mines.": "npc_book4_504",
  "This is the last one... Hey, what's that?": "npc_book6_608",
  "This should be our first official conversation.": "TK-V114-Pmle102",
  "The biology room's elevator leads directly to the bottom of the fortress, but we'll have to enter the control room to restore power to the elevator.": "TK-001-5026",
  "This is most likely the result of a flaw in the spacetime transmission device designed by Cass.": "TK-104-6003",
  "Even if they aren't going to experiment on us, we planned on running away, and even if we end up getting shouted at by Foreman Giggs, we have to sneak back to the mine first.": "TK-667-5001",
  "So I decided to bring the boys along. Shouldn't you welcome us?": "TK-218-1024",
  "The batch was manufactured in Area 4, a vital research base of ours.": "TK-401-4032",
  "Is that a <blue>dogbot</>?": "npc_book_301",
  "Is this a complete map for a technology expo?": "npc_book6_703",
  "What is this...?": "TK-option-127",
  "This is... a video message from Rubilia.": "v21TK-V107-0071",
  "Project <blue>X-7</>, also known as the Mimicry Program, is an undisclosed project of Hykros that is currently under development.": "TK-101-1060",
  "What is that beautiful little card...?": "TK-010-1247",
  "What's this? It looks like a manifesto or something.": "Area2-player-000_f",
  "This was his decision. Even though I could never approve of it, I still respect his choice.": "q204014_00_04",
  "Is this the chip you lost?": "TK-player-3018_f",
  "This is your childhood secret base? But Ms. Cobalt-B, you said this place is trouble.": "TK-player-1419_f",
  "And this is for you: another one of Dr. Luhn's belongings.": "q204009_00_04",
  "It's the doctor's... order. You must get rid of... <blue>Black Dog</>.": "TK-304-3008",
  "We don't have a lot of options. It's the best of a bad bunch!": "TK-player-V010_f",
  "This is the master AI for the Development Center. You can unlock new areas gradually here. The island is not big, but it's still worth a tour or two.": "TK-207-1054",
  "This is very important. The machine Krisman picked up might have something to do with the Heirs of Aida...": "npc_book_3_309",
  "That's the way things are around here. If one of us changed, the one closest to them will have to put them down. At the very least, they can go with some dignity.": "TK-013-1042",
  "Here's the <blue>fruit cake</> I made. It's probably not as yummy as your mother's, but happy birthday, Nico!": "TK-025-1008",
  "Bear in mind. This is the last time.": "TK-player-2102_f",
  "This is my new friend from Astra.": "TK-216-1009",
  "I just made that up. Guess I got the wrong person.": "TK-player-1114_f",
  "This is the most difficult and dangerous choice I've ever had to make. The fortress is heavily defended, and the Sage is protected by the Angels of Clemency.": "TK-001-5023",
  "Well, since they belong to Hykros, I'd like to take them back with me.": "q204001_02_07",
  "This is a kind of miniature spacetime repeater developed by Hykros, but the technology is not yet mature and is still in the redacted experimental stage.": "TK-109-1015",
  "This is the only feasible way for now. The Heirs of Aida destroyed the operational logic of the spacerift, and the technicians are trying to restore it. They need time...": "TK-002-6005",
  "This is a wish card. We write our deepest thoughts and wishes on them and stick them all over the port.": "TK-203-1154",
  "This is the master AI for the energy collectors. When the mainframe is finished, it will begin operation.": "TK-207-1056",
  "This is the best that the vehicle research department has to offer... I suppose. According to the manual, it runs on pure Omnium, has a carbon alloy body and magnetic brakes. 280 horsepower with a torque of 300. Speed, up to 230...": "TK-cobalt-1003",
  "It belongs to the old owner of that house. She saved my life.": "npc_book_2_205",
  "Granny Lucy came up with those names. She raised us as orphans, and this is the place where we grew up. This is... Our home.": "TK-1103-1021",
  "Hykros is supposed to be responsible for this, so we'll compensate you.": "npc_book4_213",
  "It's a very critical intel! You won't regret it!": "TK-311-3044",
  "With a hug like this, you'll have nothing to be afraid of!": "TK-V113-p110",
  "Maybe she wanted me to feel better about myself.": "v60400-TK-109-026",
  "I see. Personally, I'm not comfortable with the plan.": "TK-302-3103",
  "Is that so... Uh... I might have a play around with it later...": "TK-V105-0029",
  "How about this: as a token of gratitude and repayment, I'll give you our newest product, the latest combat support system.": "TK-207-1041",
  "I know! Take my Jetpack. You'll get there way faster! Just be careful with it. And If anything dangerous happens, just run!": "TK-010-1168",
  "I see..._f": "v60400-TK-player-004_f",
  "I see... Any idea how long that might be?": "TK-peppa-V001",
  "I see... Hope Theo gets better soon.": "TK-203-1078",
  "That's it... That's great. Pelo's situation has stabilized. The next step is to see Diana's decision.": "npc_book3_903",
  "I see, {0}...": "TK-1104-1018",
  "That's... very kind of you to say.": "v60400-TK-109-017",
  "Now it's complete.": "npc_book_2_402",
  "This will allow me to trace the trajectory of spacetime transmissions and identify the fragments of spacetime that have been affected by him.": "TK-104-6009",
  "That would work!": "TK-option-194",
  "How can we make it through days like this...?": "TK-030-1001",
  "It's a combination of their hard work and your guidance.": "v60400-TK-107-052",
  "Seems like I just got the door opened.": "TK-player-1403_f",
  "So, are you satisfied?": "TK-010-1199",
  "Alright, good. Let me set up the studio's alarm system first. I've put in so much work. It'd be such a pain if anyone were to come in and mess around, undermining everything I've done...": "TK-cobalt-1034",
  "You can now get familiar first and look forward to what it looks like after it's completed.": "TK-207-1090",
  "We called everyone here today for the relevant affairs of Rubilia and Confounding Abyss. I have now decided to relaunch the exploration of the Confounding Abyss.": "v21TK-V103-0035",
  "The main reason I returned is to spend more time with granny, and then it's celebrating the festival with Huma.": "TK-1103-1085",
  "I'm gonna win it again this time and be the triple champion! You get it? It's mine!": "TK-0063-1002",
  "The cause of this spacetime anomaly has been identified, Executor. Thank you for your assistance.": "TK-109-1018",
  "The reason for this spacetime fluctuation has not been confirmed, but Buru is analyzing all the relevant parameters. It could be an unfortunate side effect of the long-range transmission.": "TK-V101-0014",
  "The mission this time is to ask you to act as Shirli's guardian as you accompany her to the Vera region.": "TK-104-V005",
  "It all cost a pretty penny. We had to get the equipment needed for all the different games.": "TK-cobalt-1101",
  "It is a severe outbreak. I'm doing everything I can to alleviate the situation, from giving them time off to finding a proper treatment plan.": "TK-401-4002",
  "I totally appreciate what you've done this time.": "TK-cobalt-1078",
  "I owe you... I didn't expect they'd stoop so low.": "TK-313-5001",
  "Thanks for the effort.": "npc_book5_628",
  "No doubt that person in the video is the mysterious Sage. Looks like Zeke had been in contact with the Heirs of Aida for a while now.": "TK-002-1158",
  "Thank you for spending so much time on this.": "TK-cobalt-1064",
  "That's... truly unbelievable.": "v21TK-010-V014",
  "I never want to feel that powerlessness ever again.": "npc_book3_907",
  "This trait is something we've never seen or even considered before, I admit... Perhaps I was too optimistic, and let myself get a little careless. I will take full responsibility for this incident.": "TK-V115-0014",
  "This phenomenon has happened before, but this is the first time I've seen it trigger multiple times in such a short time span.": "TK-101-1044",
  "We call this phenomenon \"Phantasia.\" It's a human-generated temporal distortion in a localized area. It's usually an ability only exhibited by Executors.": "TK-102-1031",
  "It's hereditary. His father died of the same illness because there was no treatment for it at the time.": "npc_book3_708",
  "Why would the drug contain virus strains created by the Heirs of Aida?": "TK-player-4081_f",
  "Such a device can transmit targets within a certain range back to a specific time in the past. Knowing his character, I presume that he wants to send those cloned angels back to the past and change the fact that we defeated the Sage.": "TK-002-2120",
  "As a personal gratitude on top of the reward, just let me know what you want. It can be anything.": "TK-207-1035",
  "It's a new development, and we are looking for testers. You seem like a good candidate.": "TK-207-1043",
  "If this really is from Samir, you don't think she put a bomb in it or something... Right?": "TK-player-1371_f",
  "You didn't hear that from me. Anyway, the bigwig client instructed me to deliver the Astrum to a specified location. That's all I can say.": "TK-2006-1020",
  "The door on this side is also open. I remember the thing I want was placed inside...": "TK-cobalt-1069",
  "Well... It's all Dr. Burkman's fault! He is researching how to control aberration responses...": "TK-311-3033",
  "The spacerift's energy has been exhausted. Someone has to go to the upper control room and restart the charging process.": "TK-002-5062",
  "Here's a set... Take it back... to Bai Ling for me... They could use it...": "TK-227-5004",
  "There must be important clues in here. Search thoroughly.": "v21TK-122-Vp004",
  "You're the only one here with the talent to get this done.": "TK-002-6015",
  "Will there be anything Mr. Fred wants here?": "npc_book2_201",
  "What happened here?": "TK-player-2037_f",
  "Here was originally a small Cataclysm shelter. President Kolador actually started off as an R&D guy specializing in vehicles.": "npc_book6_313",
  "It's exactly the same as when it was sealed off two years ago. But maybe I missed something back then...": "v21TK-122-Vp003",
  "Here's a workstation. When activated, its smart servant will be able to conduct harvesting autonomously.": "TK-207-1087",
  "This is the southern valley. Una should be around here.": "TK-037-1004",
  "This must be where the doctor used to live.": "v21TK-010-Vp004",
  "This is the entrance to the lab.": "v21TK-V107-0027",

  "I don't recall such eloquence from you back then, Director Franz. In comparison, I think I prefer your fifty-year younger self.": "TK-313-3070",
